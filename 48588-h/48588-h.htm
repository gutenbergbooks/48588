<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The title of this book indicates at once its aim and
its limitations. It makes no pretence to be a complete
history of the early industrial life of England,
but at the same time it does claim to be an introduction
to the study of that subject. It is my hope,
and indeed my belief, that from it the general reader,
equipped with interest in the history of his country
rather than with technical knowledge, will obtain
something more than a bare outline of industrial
conditions in pre-Elizabethan days. The student
who is anxious to go more deeply into the subjects
here treated may use this book as a road map and
the footnotes as finger-posts to guide him to the
heights of completer knowledge.</p>

<p>From the nature of my subject it was inevitable
that the book should be full of technicalities, figures,
and statistics, but it has been my endeavour to
render the technicalities intelligible, and to prevent
the significance of the statistics being obscured by
an excess of detail. The scheme which I have
adopted is to treat the leading medieval industries
one by one, showing as far as possible their chief
centres, their chronological development, the conditions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>and the methods of working. With the
disposal of the finished products through intermediaries,
merchants, or shopkeepers, I have not
concerned myself, deeming such matters rather to
belong to the realms of trade and commerce than
of industry; and for this same reason, and also
because it has been dealt with by other writers, I
have not dealt with the great source of England's
wealth—wool. Agriculture, also, and fishing I have
excluded from my definition of industry. A more
culpable omission, which I think calls for a word
of explanation, is shown in the case of building.
This, however, is not omitted by an oversight, nor
yet through any desire to save myself trouble. I
had collected a great mass of material for an intended
section on the Building Industry, but after careful
consideration I came to the conclusion that the
material available was so exceedingly technical, and
the obscurity of the details so greatly in excess of
their value when elucidated, as to render such a
section rather a weariness and a stumbling-block
to the student than a help. The subjects treated
in the several sections are thoroughly representative,
if not completely exhaustive, of English industrial
life, and a general survey of the subject is contained
in my last chapter, where I have outlined as broadly
as possible the general principles that governed the
Control of Industry—the typical regulations made
by, or for, the craftsmen in the interest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>employer, the workman, or the consumer. This
last section might, of course, easily have been extended
to cover more pages than this whole volume,
but it is questionable whether multiplicity of detail
tends to ease of assimilation. A single typical
instance of a prevalent custom or regulation is as
significant as a list of a dozen local variations, and
far easier to remember. A rule is more easily
remembered by one example than by a score, and
with such a wealth of material as exists the risk of
obscurity is greater from amplification than from
concentration.</p>

<p>As to defining what is meant by the medieval
period, it is not easy to lay down any hard and fast
rule, for the change from old methods or conditions
to new, which practically constitutes the division
between the medieval and the modern periods,
occurred at a different date in each industry. The
crucial point in gunfounding was the invention of
solid boring in the time of Henry <span class="smcap lowercase"><abbr title="the eighth">VIII</abbr>.</span>; in the cloth
industry it was the introduction of the 'new
draperies' by Protestant refugees in the reign of
Elizabeth; for iron mining it was the adoption of
pit coal for smelting in the seventeenth century;
for coal mining, the application of steam power
to solve the problems of drainage at great depths
early in the eighteenth century. Yet, taking
one thing with another, the sixteenth century
may be considered to be the period of transition.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>The rise of the capitalist and the monopolist, the
social revolution of the Reformation, with the abolition
of the monastic houses and the beginnings of the
Poor-Law system constituted a new era for the
working classes even when unaccompanied by any
startling change in methods or mechanical media.
Moreover, from the middle of the sixteenth century
documents and records relating to industrial matters
become more numerous and more accessible, and this
is therefore the usual starting-point for those who
write upon these subjects. For these reasons my
accounts of the various selected industries will be
found to end at such dates within the sixteenth
century as have seemed convenient, though I have
not slavishly refrained from taking out of the
seventeenth century occasional details applicable
to the earlier period.</p>

<p>Such, then, are the lines upon which I have built
my book. If any critic considers that the subject
should have been dealt with on another plan, he is
at liberty to prove his contention by so treating it
himself.</p>

<p>As to the sources from which my information is
taken: I believe that every statement will be found
to be buttressed by at least one reference, and I
may add that the reference is invariably to the
actual source from which I obtained my information.
Of printed sources much the most valuable have
been the series of articles on local industries printed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>in the <cite>Victoria County Histories</cite>, those on mining
and kindred subjects by Mr. C. H. Vellacott being
of exceptional importance. In very few cases have
I found any published history of any industry
dealing at all fully with the early period: the one
conspicuous exception was Mr. G. Randall Lewis's
book on <cite>The Stannaries</cite>, second to which may be
put Mr. Galloway's <cite>Annals of Coal Mining</cite>. The
various volumes of municipal records published
by, or with the consent of, the public-spirited
authorities of some of our ancient boroughs, notably
those of Norwich, Bristol, Coventry, and Leicester,
have been of great value to me, as have Mr. Riley's
<cite>Memorials of London</cite> and his editions of the <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Liber
Albus</cite> and <cite xml:lang="la" lang="la">Liber Custumarum</cite>. To such other
printed works as I have drawn upon, acknowledgment
is made in the footnotes, but so far as possible
I have made use of unpublished manuscript material
at the British Museum and still more at the Record
Office. Needless to say, I collected far more material
than it was possible to use, and I can only hope that
my selection has been wise, as it certainly was careful,
and that I have not overlooked or omitted any
evidence of essential importance. It had originally
been my intention to compile a series of transcripts
of industrial records on lines similar to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Documents
relatifs à l'Industrie</cite> of M. Fagniez, but the
enormous mass of material available for such a
work, coupled with the fact that in England such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>original research has to be carried out at the sole
expense of the unfortunate researcher, put an
end to the project, and deprived this work of
what would have been a valuable, if formidable,
companion volume.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I</abbr><br />

<small>MINING—COAL</small></h2>


<p>Coal is so intimately connected with all that is
essentially modern—machinery, steam, and the
black pall that overhangs our great towns and manufacturing
districts—that it comes almost as a surprise
to find it in use in Britain at the beginning of the
Christian era. Yet excavation has proved beyond
all doubt that coal was used by the Romans, ashes
and stores of the unburnt mineral being found all
along the Wall, at Lanchester and Ebchester in
Durham,<a name="Anchor-1" id="Anchor-1"></a><a href="#Footnote-1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at Wroxeter<a name="Anchor-2" id="Anchor-2"></a><a href="#Footnote-2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> in Shropshire and elsewhere.
For the most part it appears to have been
used for working iron, but it was possibly also used
for heating hypocausts, and there seems good reason
to believe that it formed the fuel of the sacred fire
in the temple of Minerva at Bath, as Solinus, writing
about the end of the third century, comments on
the 'stony balls' which were left as ashes by this
sacred fire.<a name="Anchor-3" id="Anchor-3"></a><a href="#Footnote-3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> That such coal as was used by the
Romans was obtained from outcrops, where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>seams came to the surface, is more than probable.
There appears to be no certain evidence of any
regular mining at this period.</p>

<p>With the departure of the Romans from Britain
coal went out of use, and no trace of its employment
can be found prior to the Norman Conquest, or
indeed for more than a century after that date. It
was not until quite the end of the twelfth century
that coal was rediscovered, and the history of its
use in England may be said for all practical purposes
to begin with the reign of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> (1216). In the
'Boldon Book'<a name="Anchor-4" id="Anchor-4"></a><a href="#Footnote-4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> survey of the see of Durham,
compiled in 1183, there are several references to
smiths who were bound to make ploughshares and
to 'find the coal' therefor, but unfortunately the
Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">invenire</i> bears the same double meaning
as its English equivalent 'to find,' and may imply
either discovery or simple provision. In view of the
fact that the word used for coal (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carbonem</i>) in this
passage is unqualified, and that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">carbo</i>, as also the
English 'cole,' practically always implies charcoal,
it would be unsafe to conclude that mineral coal is
here referred to. The latter is almost invariably
given a distinguishing adjective, appearing as earth
coal, subterranean coal, stone coal, quarry coal, etc.,
but far most frequently as 'sea coal.' The origin
of this term may perhaps be indicated by a passage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>in a sixteenth-century account of the salt works in
the county of Durham:<a name="Anchor-5" id="Anchor-5"></a><a href="#Footnote-5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> 'As the tide comes in
it bringeth a small wash sea coal which is employed
to the making of salt and the fuel of the poor fisher
towns adjoining.' It is most probable that the first
coal used was that thus washed up by the sea and
such as could be quarried from the face of the cliffs
where the seams were exposed by the action of the
waves. The term was next applied, for convenience,
to similar coal obtained inland, and as an export
trade grew up it acquired the secondary significance
of sea-borne coal.</p>

<p>No references to purchases of sea coal occur in the
Pipe Rolls of Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>, nor, so far as I am aware, in
those of Richard <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr> and John, but it would seem that
its existence was known before the end of the twelfth
century, as Alexander Neckam in his treatise, <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De
Naturis Rerum</cite>,<a name="Anchor-6" id="Anchor-6"></a><a href="#Footnote-6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> has a curious and puzzling section,
'<cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Carbone</cite>,' at the beginning of his discourse on
minerals, parts of which seem applicable to sea
coal, though other parts appear to refer to charcoal.
So far as can be gathered, he considered sea coal to
be charcoal found in the earth; he comments on
the extreme durability of coal and its resistance to
the effects of wet and the lapse of time, and makes
the interesting statement that when men were
setting up boundary stones they dug in below them
a quantity of coal, and that in the event of a dispute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>as to the position of the stone in later years the
presence of this coal was the determining factor.
Whether there is any corroborative evidence of this
alleged custom I have not been able to ascertain,
but it is at least a proof that mineral coal was known,
though evidently not extensively used for fuel at
this period. Coal was apparently worked in Scotland
about 1200,<a name="Anchor-7" id="Anchor-7"></a><a href="#Footnote-7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a> and it would seem that about
a quarter of a century later it was being imported
into London, as a mention of Sea Coal Lane, just
outside the walls of the city, near Ludgate, occurs
in 1228.<a name="Anchor-8" id="Anchor-8"></a><a href="#Footnote-8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> As property in this lane belonged to
William 'de Plessetis,' it is probable that the coal
was brought from Plessey, near Blyth, in which
neighbourhood the monks of Newminster were given
the right to take coal along the shore about 1236.<a name="Anchor-9" id="Anchor-9"></a><a href="#Footnote-9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a>
The monks also obtained leave from Nicholas de
Aketon about the same time to take sea coals in
his wood of Middlewood for use at their forge of
Stretton, near Alnwick. It may be remarked that
at this time, and for the greater part of the next
three centuries, the use of coal was restricted to
iron-working and lime-burning, the absence of
chimneys rendering it unsuitable for fuel in ordinary
living rooms. So particularly was it associated with
lime-burning that we find Sea Coal Lane also known
as Lime-burners Lane, and references in building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>accounts to purchases of sea coal for the burning
of lime are innumerable.</p>

<p>It is in 1243 that we get our first dated reference
to an actual coal working. In that year Ralf, son
of Roger Wlger, was recorded to have been drowned
'in a delf of sea coals' (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in fossato carbonum maris</i>).<a name="Anchor-10" id="Anchor-10"></a><a href="#Footnote-10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a>
The use of the word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fossatum</i> is interesting, as clearly
indicating an 'open cast working,' that is to say, a
comparatively shallow trench carried along the seam
where it comes close to the surface, a step intermediate
between the mere quarrying of outcrop
and the sinking of regular pits. An indication of
the spread of coal mining is to be found in one of
the articles of inquiry for the Forest Assize of 1244,
which relates to 'sea coal found within the forest,
and whether any one has taken money for the
digging of the same.'<a name="Anchor-11" id="Anchor-11"></a><a href="#Footnote-11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> It is probable that special
reference was intended to the Forest of Dean, coal
being worked about this time at Blakeney, Stainton,
and Abinghall; from the last named place a penny
on every horse-load of coal was paid to the Constable
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavels, as warden of the Forest.<a name="Anchor-12" id="Anchor-12"></a><a href="#Footnote-12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> By 1255
the issues of the Forest of Dean included payments
for digging sea coals, and customs on all sea coal
brought down the Severn.<a name="Anchor-13" id="Anchor-13"></a><a href="#Footnote-13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> Some of this latter may
have been quarried in Shropshire, as about 1260
Walter de Clifford licensed Sir John de Halston to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>dig for coals in the forest of Clee,<a name="Anchor-14" id="Anchor-14"></a><a href="#Footnote-14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> and there are
other indications of the early exploitation of the
Shropshire coal-field. The Midland field of Derbyshire
and Notts was also working, coal being got
in Duffield Frith in 1257,<a name="Anchor-15" id="Anchor-15"></a><a href="#Footnote-15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a> the year in which
Queen Eleanor was driven from Nottingham Castle
by the unpleasant fumes of the sea coal used in
the busy town below,<a name="Anchor-16" id="Anchor-16"></a><a href="#Footnote-16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> a singularly early instance
of the smoke nuisance which we are apt to consider
a modern evil. Half a century later, in 1307, the
growing use of coal by lime-burners in London became
so great a nuisance that its use was rigorously prohibited,
but whether successfully may be questioned.<a name="Anchor-17" id="Anchor-17"></a><a href="#Footnote-17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a></p>

<p>By the end of the thirteenth century it would
seem that practically all the English coal-fields were
being worked to some extent. In Northumberland
so numerous were the diggings round Newcastle
that it was dangerous to approach the town in the
dark, and the monks of Tynemouth also were
making good use of their mineral wealth;<a name="Anchor-18" id="Anchor-18"></a><a href="#Footnote-18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> in Yorkshire
coal was being got at Shippen at least as early
as 1262,<a name="Anchor-19" id="Anchor-19"></a><a href="#Footnote-19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> and in Warwickshire and at Chilvers Coton
in 1275.<a name="Anchor-20" id="Anchor-20"></a><a href="#Footnote-20" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 20.">[20]</a> The small Somerset field near Stratton on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Fosse and the Staffordshire coal measures may be
possible exceptions, but in the latter county coal
was dug at Bradley in 1315 and at Amblecote during
the reign of Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr><a name="Anchor-21" id="Anchor-21"></a><a href="#Footnote-21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> The diggings were still
for the most part open-cast works, but pits were
beginning to come in. These 'bell pits,' of which
numbers remained until recently in the neighbourhood
of Leeds,<a name="Anchor-22" id="Anchor-22"></a><a href="#Footnote-22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> at Oldham in Lancashire,<a name="Anchor-23" id="Anchor-23"></a><a href="#Footnote-23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> and elsewhere,
were narrow shafts sunk down to the coal
and then enlarged at the bottom, and widened as
far as was safe—and sometimes farther, if we may
judge from a number of instances in Derbyshire
in which miners were killed by the fall of their pits.<a name="Anchor-24" id="Anchor-24"></a><a href="#Footnote-24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a>
When as much coal as could safely be removed had
been obtained, the pit was abandoned and a fresh
pit sunk as near to it as possible. As a rule the old
pit had to be filled up, and at Nuneaton we find this
very properly enforced by the bailiff in 1343,<a name="Anchor-25" id="Anchor-25"></a><a href="#Footnote-25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> and
at later dates. Open coal delfs were a source of
considerable danger to men and animals, especially
when water had accumulated in them, and a number
of cattle were drowned at Morley in Derbyshire in
1372,<a name="Anchor-26" id="Anchor-26"></a><a href="#Footnote-26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a> while it was probably in an abandoned
working at Wingerworth that a beggar woman,
Maud Webster, was killed in 1313 by a mass of soil
falling on her as she was picking up coal.<a name="Anchor-27" id="Anchor-27"></a><a href="#Footnote-27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> From the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>pits the coal was raised in corves, or large baskets,
and as early as 1291 we have a case of a man being
killed at Denby in a 'colpyt' by one of these loaded
corves falling upon his head.<a name="Anchor-28" id="Anchor-28"></a><a href="#Footnote-28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a></p>

<p>A case of some interest is recorded in Derbyshire
in 1322, when Emma, daughter of William Culhare,
while drawing water from the 'colepyt' at Morley
was killed by 'le Damp,' <i>i.e.</i> choke damp.<a name="Anchor-29" id="Anchor-29"></a><a href="#Footnote-29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> This is
one of the very few early references to choke damp,
or 'stithe,' as it was often called, and the case is
also interesting because, as water from a coal pit
could hardly be good for either drinking or washing
purposes, she must have been engaged in draining
the pit, and this suggests a pit of rather exceptional
dimensions. A more certain indication of a considerable
depth having been attained is given forty
years later in the case of another pit at Morley Park,
said to have been drowned, or flooded, 'for lack of
a gutter.'<a name="Anchor-30" id="Anchor-30"></a><a href="#Footnote-30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> This may only refer to a surface drain,
but there is abundant proof that regular drainage
by watergates, soughs, or adits had already come
into use, and that coal-mining had reached the
'pit and adit' stage. In this system of working,
the water, always the most troublesome enemy of
the miner, was drawn off by a subterranean drain
leading from the bottom of the pit. It need hardly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>be pointed out that the system was only practicable
on fairly high ground, where the bottom of the pit
was above the level of free drainage: in such a case
a horizontal gallery, or adit, could be driven from a
suitable point on the face of the hill slightly below
the bottom of the pit to strike the latter, and a
wooden sough,<a name="Anchor-31" id="Anchor-31"></a><a href="#Footnote-31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a> or drain, of which the sections were
known in Warwickshire as 'dearns,' could be laid
to carry the water from the pit to a convenient point
of discharge. In 1354 the monks of Durham, when
obtaining a lease of coal mines in Ferry, had leave
to place pits and watergates where suitable,<a name="Anchor-32" id="Anchor-32"></a><a href="#Footnote-32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> and
ten years later a lease of a mine at Gateshead stipulated
for provision of timber for the pits and water-gate.<a name="Anchor-33" id="Anchor-33"></a><a href="#Footnote-33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a>
During the next century a certain number
of pits were sunk in lower ground, or to a greater
depth, below the level of free drainage, and in 1486
we find the monks of Finchale, active exploiters of
the northern coal measures, erecting a pump worked
by horse power at Moorhouse,<a name="Anchor-34" id="Anchor-34"></a><a href="#Footnote-34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> but it is not until
the second half of the sixteenth century, nearly at
the end of the medieval period, that we find such
pumps, 'gins,' or baling engines, and similar machines
in common use.</p>

<p>Piecing together information afforded by scattered
entries, we can obtain some idea of the working of
a coal pit about the end of the fifteenth century.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>After the overseer, or a body of miners, had inspected
the ground and chosen a likely place, a space was
marked out, and a small sum distributed among the
workers as earnest money. The pit was then sunk
at such charge as might be agreed upon: at Heworth
in 1376 the charge was six shillings the fathom,<a name="Anchor-35" id="Anchor-35"></a><a href="#Footnote-35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a>
at Griff in 1603 six shillings the ell.<a name="Anchor-36" id="Anchor-36"></a><a href="#Footnote-36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> A small
'reward' was paid when the vein of coal was struck,
the pit was then cleaned up and timbered, and a
water-gate or adit driven to afford drainage and
ventilation. Over the mouth of the pit was erected
a thatched 'hovel' with wattled sides to keep the
wind and rain from the pit, and in this was a windlass
for raising the corves. The workmen consisted
of hewers, who cut the coal, and bearers who carried
it to the bottom of the pit and filled the corves:
they were under the control of the 'viewer,' whose
duty it was 'to see under the ground that the work
was orderly wrought,' and the 'overman,' who had
'to see such work as come up at every pit to be for
the coal owner's profit.'<a name="Anchor-37" id="Anchor-37"></a><a href="#Footnote-37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> Their wages do not
appear to have been much, if at all, above those of
the ordinary labourer or unskilled artisan. Owing
no doubt to the comparatively late rise of the
industry and the simplicity of the work, no refining
or skilled manipulation being required as in the case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>of metallic ores, the coal miners never acquired the
privileged position of the 'free miners' of Dean,
Derbyshire, Cumberland, and Cornwall.<a name="Anchor-38" id="Anchor-38"></a><a href="#Footnote-38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> The work
was not attractive, and the supply of labour seems
occasionally to have run dry. So much was this
the case after the Black Death in 1350 and the
second epidemic of 1366 that the lessees of the great
mines at Whickham and Gateshead had to resort
to forced labour, and obtained leave to impress
workmen.<a name="Anchor-39" id="Anchor-39"></a><a href="#Footnote-39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> Much later, about 1580, the Winlaton
pits were hampered by lack of workmen and the
owners, having sent into Scotland for more hands
with little success, had to hire women and even then
were short-handed, to say nothing of being troubled
with incompetent men who for their negligence and
false work had to be 'laid in the stocks,' and even
'expulsed oute of their worke.'<a name="Anchor-40" id="Anchor-40"></a><a href="#Footnote-40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>

<p>The question of mineral rights as regards coal is
complicated by the variety of local customs. In
some cases, as at Bolsover,<a name="Anchor-41" id="Anchor-41"></a><a href="#Footnote-41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> the manorial tenants
had the right to dig sea coal in the waste and forest
land for their own use; but it was probably usual
to charge a fee for licence to dig, and this was clearly
the practice at Wakefield.<a name="Anchor-42" id="Anchor-42"></a><a href="#Footnote-42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a> So far as copyhold lands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>were concerned the lord of the manor, or his farmer,
appears as a rule to have had the power to dig
without paying the tenant compensation. This
was certainly being done at Houghton, in Yorkshire,
and in the adjacent manor of Kipax in 1578, and the
undoubted injury to the copyholders was held to be
counterbalanced by the advantage to the neighbourhood
of a cheap supply of coal.<a name="Anchor-43" id="Anchor-43"></a><a href="#Footnote-43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> The uncertainty
of the law and the conflicting claims of ground
landlords, tenants, and prospectors led to a plentiful
crop of legal actions. For the most part these were
actions for trespass in digging coal without leave,
occasionally complicated by counter appeals.<a name="Anchor-44" id="Anchor-44"></a><a href="#Footnote-44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a> In
the first half of the sixteenth century, for instance,
Nicholas Strelley, being impleaded for trespass by
Sir John Willoughby, set forth that he had a pit in
Strelley from which he obtained much coal, to the
advantage of the neighbourhood and of 'the schyres
of Leicestre and Lincoln, being very baren and
scarce contres of all maner of fuell'; and no doubt,
though he omitted to say so, to his own advantage;
now, owing to the deepness of the mine and the
amount of water, the old pit could only be worked
if a sough or drain were constructed at an unreasonable
expense; he had therefore dug a fresh pit on
the borders of Strelly close to Sir John's manor of
Wollaton, purposing to use an old sough running
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>through Sir John's ground. Sir John had promptly
blocked the sough with a 'counter-mure' and
brought actions for trespass, and Nicholas Strelley,
much aggrieved, invoked the aid of the Star Chamber.<a name="Anchor-45" id="Anchor-45"></a><a href="#Footnote-45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a>
The same court was also invoked a few years
later by William Bolles, who complained that by
the procurement of Sir William Hussey certain
persons came to Newthorpe Mere in Gresley and
'most cruelly and maliciously cutt in peaces brake
and caste downe dyvers frames of tymbre made
upon and in one pitte made and sonken to gett
cooles, and cutt in peaces dyvers greate ropes loomes
and tooles apperteyninge to the said woorke at the
said pitte,' the offenders being unidentified as the
outrage took place 'in the night tyme when every
good trew and faithful subjecte ought to take their
reste.'<a name="Anchor-46" id="Anchor-46"></a><a href="#Footnote-46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a></p>

<p>Presuming an undisputed title, the owner of coal
measures could exploit them in a variety of ways.
He might work them himself; the outlay would be
small, provided extensive drainage operations were
not required, for wages, as we have said, were low
and the equipment of the mine, consisting of a few
picks, iron bars or wedges, wooden shovels shod
with iron and baskets, buckets, and ropes, inexpensive,
and there was a steady sale for the coal,
though the price of coal varied so greatly and was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>so much affected by cost of carriage that it is
not possible to give even an approximate average
value for the medieval period; the question being
further complicated by the extraordinary variety of
measure employed. Coal is quoted in terms of
the 'hundredweight,' the 'quarter' (valued at
Colchester in 1296 at 6d.),<a name="Anchor-47" id="Anchor-47"></a><a href="#Footnote-47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> the 'seam' (or horse-load),
the 'load,' which may be either horse or wain
load, the 'scope,' which appears to be equivalent
to the 'corf,' or basket, the 'roke' or 'rowe,' the
'rod' or 'perch' (a measure apparently peculiar to
Warwickshire),<a name="Anchor-48" id="Anchor-48"></a><a href="#Footnote-48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> the 'butress' and the 'three-quarters'
(of a buttress), and most commonly in the
Tyne district by the 'fother,' 'chalder,' or 'chaldron'
and 'ten,' and also by the 'keel' or barge
load. Where the owner did not work the coals
himself he could either issue annual licences to dig
coal or lease the mines for a term of years.<a name="Anchor-49" id="Anchor-49"></a><a href="#Footnote-49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a> The
earliest leases give a vague general permission to
dig coal wherever found within the lands in question,
but it soon became usual to limit the output either
by fixing the maximum amount to be taken in one
day, or more usually in early leases by restricting
the number of workmen to be employed. In 1326
Hugh of Scheynton granted to Adam Peyeson land
at Benthall with all quarries of sea coal, employing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>four labourers to dig the same, and as many as he
chose to carry the coals to the Severn.<a name="Anchor-50" id="Anchor-50"></a><a href="#Footnote-50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> Slightly
before this date we find that payment was made
at Belper according to the number of picks employed,
the royalty on one pick in 1315 being over £4.<a name="Anchor-51" id="Anchor-51"></a><a href="#Footnote-51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a>
In 1380 the prior of Beauvale in leasing a mine of
sea coal at Newthorpe to Robert Pascayl and seven
other partners,<a name="Anchor-52" id="Anchor-52"></a><a href="#Footnote-52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a> stipulated that they should have
only got two men in the pit, a viewer (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">servaunt de
south la terre</i>), and three men above ground. The
lessees of a pit at Trillesden in 1447 were 'to work
and win coal every day overable [<i>i.e.</i> working day]
with three picks and ilk pick to win every day 60
scopes,'<a name="Anchor-53" id="Anchor-53"></a><a href="#Footnote-53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a> and at Nuneaton, in 1553, the lessees were
not to employ more than six workmen at the time.<a name="Anchor-54" id="Anchor-54"></a><a href="#Footnote-54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a>
In this latter case there was a further stipulation
that the pits when exhausted should be filled up
with 'yearthe and slecke,' while at Trillesden the
pit was to be worked workmanlike and the miners
were to 'save the field standing,' pointing to a fairly
elaborate system of galleries and pillars liable to
subsidence if not properly planned.<a name="Anchor-55" id="Anchor-55"></a><a href="#Footnote-55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> But the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>important lease was that of five mines in Whickham,
made in 1356 by Bishop Hatfield of Durham to Sir
Thomas Gray and the Rector of Whickham for the
enormous rent of 500 marks (£333, 6s. 8d.).<a name="Anchor-56" id="Anchor-56"></a><a href="#Footnote-56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a> In
this case the lessees were limited to one keel (about
twenty tons) daily from each mine; but on the other
hand the bishop agreed never to take their workmen
away, and not to open any fresh pits in the district,
and not to sell the coal from his existing pits at
Gateshead to ships. A century later Sir William
Eure leased some of the most important Durham
coal mines, his daily output being restricted to
340 corves at Raly, 300 at Toftes, 600 at Hartkeld,
and 20 at any other mines, with the right of making
up from one mine any deficiency in another, and also
of making up any deficiency caused by delays due
to 'styth' or choke-damp, which appears to have
been so troublesome in the hot season as to cause a
complete suspension of work. Under this lease Sir
William obtained at Raly in one week of 1460, some
1800 corves, each of 2½ bushels, making rather over
140 chalders, paying 5d. a day to each of the three
hewers, the three barrowmen, who brought the coal
to the foot of the shaft, and the four drawers who
raised and banked it.<a name="Anchor-57" id="Anchor-57"></a><a href="#Footnote-57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a></p>

<p>In the Whickham lease of 1356 it will be noticed
that the bishop undertook not to allow coals from
his own pits to be exported by sea. The sea-borne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>trade in coals from Newcastle and the Tyne was
obtaining considerable dimensions; ten years later,
in 1366, a large purchase of coal was made at Winlaton
for the king's works at Windsor. The sheriff
of Northumberland accounted for £165, 5s. 2d.
expended on the purchase and carriage to London
of 576 chalder of coals, reckoning by the 'great
hundred' of six score, so that there were actually
shipped 676 chalder, but of this 86 chalder had to
be written off, partly through some being jettisoned
during a sudden storm at sea, and partly because
the London chalder was much bigger than that used
in Northumberland, the difference amounting to
about five per cent.<a name="Anchor-58" id="Anchor-58"></a><a href="#Footnote-58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> The chalder, or chaldron,
seems to have been originally about eighteen to
twenty hundredweight, and from early times twenty
of these made the load of a keel, or coal barge, but
in order to evade the export duty of 2d. on every
keel, or at least to compensate for it, it became the
practice to build keels of twenty-two or twenty-three
chalder burden. This was forbidden in 1385,<a name="Anchor-59" id="Anchor-59"></a><a href="#Footnote-59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> but
the prohibition being evaded, an Act was passed in
1421<a name="Anchor-60" id="Anchor-60"></a><a href="#Footnote-60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a> by which the actual capacity of each keel had
to be marked upon it. This in turn was evaded by
a rapid increase in the size of the chalder, until by
the time of Elizabeth it had doubled its original
weight, and the 'ten' (chalder) was the equivalent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>of the keel of twenty tons.<a name="Anchor-61" id="Anchor-61"></a><a href="#Footnote-61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> Returning to the
fourteenth century, the customs accounts of the
port of Newcastle<a name="Anchor-62" id="Anchor-62"></a><a href="#Footnote-62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a> show that between Michaelmas
1377 and Michaelmas 1378 as much as 7338
chalder of coal, valued at 2s. the chalder, was
exported to foreign countries. For the most part
this went to the Low Countries—Sluys, Bremerhaven,
Flushing, and Dunkirk being amongst the
ports mentioned, though in a number of cases ships
of 'Lumbardye' occur, the average quantity taken
by each vessel being a little less than fifty chalder.
Of the home trade for this period no record is obtainable,
and it is not until the time of Elizabeth that
we can compare the exports to home and foreign
ports. For the seven years 1591-7, the amount sent
abroad was 95,558 chalder, rising from 10,000 in
1591 to 18,000 in 1593, and then falling gradually
back to 10,000, while the home trade amounted to
418,200 chalder, increasing steadily from 45,700 up
to over 70,000.<a name="Anchor-63" id="Anchor-63"></a><a href="#Footnote-63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> The supremacy of Newcastle is
shown by a comparison of the amounts of coal
exported to foreign countries from the chief English
ports in 1592.<a name="Anchor-64" id="Anchor-64"></a><a href="#Footnote-64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> Newcastle comes first with 12,635
chalder, then Bristol with 580, Wales with 464, and
Liverpool with 448.</p>

<p>The expansion of the home trade noticed in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>returns for 1591-7 is borne out by an abundance of
corroborative evidence, and may be largely attributed
to the great increase at this period in the use
of chimneys. Practically the chimney was an
Elizabethan invention so far as the smaller houses
were concerned, and 'the multitude of chimnies
lately erected' was one of the changes most remarked
upon by Harrison's old friends at the time that
he wrote his <cite>Description of England</cite>, published in
1577. The reign of Elizabeth, therefore, when the
rapid increase in the demand for house coal, coupled
with a rise in the price, resulted in a rapid expansion
of the industry in all parts of the country, marks
the end of the medieval period of coal mining and
the initiation of a new epoch with which we are not
concerned.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />

<small>MINING—IRON</small></h2>


<p>Iron has been worked in Britain from the earliest
historical times, and flint implements have been
found at Stainton-in-Furness and at Battle in Sussex
in positions suggesting that ironworks existed in
those places at the end of the Stone Age.<a name="Anchor-65" id="Anchor-65"></a><a href="#Footnote-65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> Julius
Cæsar relates that iron was produced along the coast
of Britain, but only in small quantities, its rarity
causing it to be considered as a precious metal,
so that iron bars were current among the natives
as money. The coming of the Romans soon changed
this. They were not slow to see the value of the
island's mineral wealth and to turn it to account.
Ironworks sprang up all over the country: at
Maresfield in Sussex they were apparently in full
swing by the time of Vespasian (died <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 79), and
in the neighbourhood of Battle fifty years later.
Even more important were the workings in the
West, on the banks of the Wye and in the Forest of
Dean. Near Coleford have been found remains of
Roman mines with shallow shafts and adits, while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>round Whitchurch, Goodrich, and Redbrook are
enormous deposits of 'cinders,' or slag, dating from
the same period.<a name="Anchor-66" id="Anchor-66"></a><a href="#Footnote-66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> Ariconium, near Ross, was a
city of smiths and forgemen; and Bath (Aquae
Sulis) is often said to have had a 'collegium
fabricensium,' or gild of smiths, as one of its
members, Julius Vitalis, armourer of the 20th Legion,
dying after nine years' service, was given a public
funeral here by his gild; but it seems more probable
that the seat of the gild was at Chester, and that
Julius had come to Bath for his health.<a name="Anchor-67" id="Anchor-67"></a><a href="#Footnote-67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a></p>

<p>It is a most remarkable fact that although abundant
circumstantial evidence of the Roman exploitation
of British iron exists in the shape of coins and
other relics found upon the site of the works, there is
practically no trace of any such working during the
Saxon period until shortly before the Conquest.
The furnaces must have been still in blast when the
Saxons landed; they were a warlike race, possessing
a full appreciation of iron and something of the
Scandinavian admiration for smithcraft, yet there is
hardly a trace of their having worked iron in this
country. Few, if any, objects definitely assignable
to this period have been found upon the site of iron
works, and documentary evidence is almost non-existent.
There is a charter of Oswy, King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>Kent, given in 689, by which he grants to the abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter of Canterbury land at Liminge 'in which
there is known to be a mine of iron';<a name="Anchor-68" id="Anchor-68"></a><a href="#Footnote-68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> and there is
the legend that about 700 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> Alcester, in Warwickshire,
was the centre of busy ironworks, peopled with
smiths, who, for their hardness of heart in refusing
to listen to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Egwin, and endeavouring to drown
his voice by beating on their anvils, were swallowed
up by the earth;<a name="Anchor-69" id="Anchor-69"></a><a href="#Footnote-69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> but the rest is silence, until we
come to the time of Edward the Confessor. The
Domesday Survey shows that in the time of the
Confessor, Gloucester rendered as part of its farm
36 dicres of iron, probably in the form of horseshoes,
and 100 rods suitable for making bolts for the king's
ships,<a name="Anchor-70" id="Anchor-70"></a><a href="#Footnote-70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> while from Pucklechurch in the same country
came yearly 90 'blooms' of iron.<a name="Anchor-71" id="Anchor-71"></a><a href="#Footnote-71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> The same Survey
mentions that there were six smiths in Hereford,
each of whom had yearly to make for the king 120
horseshoes, and it also refers to iron mines on the
borders of Cheshire, in Sussex and elsewhere.</p>

<p>During the twelfth century the industry appears
to have expanded. In the North, at Egremont, we
read of the grant of an iron mine to the monks of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Bees,<a name="Anchor-72" id="Anchor-72"></a><a href="#Footnote-72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> and at Denby a similar grant was made about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>1180 by William FitzOsbert to the abbey of Byland.<a name="Anchor-73" id="Anchor-73"></a><a href="#Footnote-73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a>
In Derbyshire, towards the end of the century, Sir
Walter de Abbetoft gave to the monks of Louth
Park wood at Birley in Brampton and two smithies,
namely one bloomery and one forge, with the right
to take beech and elm for fuel.<a name="Anchor-74" id="Anchor-74"></a><a href="#Footnote-74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> But it was in the
south-west that the greatest development took place.
During the whole of this century the Forest of Dean
was the centre of the iron industry, and played the
part that Birmingham has played in more recent
times. All through the reign of Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr> the
accounts of the sheriffs of Gloucester<a name="Anchor-75" id="Anchor-75"></a><a href="#Footnote-75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> tell of a constant
output of iron, both rough and manufactured,
iron bars, nails, pickaxes, and hammers sent to
Woodstock, Winchester, and Brill, where the king
was carrying out extensive building operations,
horseshoes supplied to the army, arrows and other
warlike materials despatched to France, spades,
pickaxes, and other miners' tools provided for the
Irish expedition of 1172, iron bought for the Crusade
which Henry projected, but did not live to perform,
and 50,000 horseshoes made for the actual Crusade
of Richard <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr> Throughout the thirteenth century
the Forest of Dean retained its practical monopoly
of the English iron trade, so far at least as the
southern counties were concerned, and during the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>whole of that time members of the family of Malemort
were employed at a forge near the castle of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavels turning out enormous stores of bolts for
cross-bows and other war material.<a name="Anchor-76" id="Anchor-76"></a><a href="#Footnote-76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> But a rival
was now growing up in the Weald of Sussex and
Kent. As early as 1254 the sheriff of Sussex had
been called upon to provide 30,000 horseshoes and
60,000 nails, presumably of local manufacture,<a name="Anchor-77" id="Anchor-77"></a><a href="#Footnote-77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a>
and in 1275 Master Henry of Lewes, who had been
the king's chief smith for the past twenty years,<a name="Anchor-78" id="Anchor-78"></a><a href="#Footnote-78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a>
purchased 406 iron rods (<i>kiville</i>) 'in the Weald'
for £16, 17s. 11d.,<a name="Anchor-79" id="Anchor-79"></a><a href="#Footnote-79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> while a year or two later he
obtained another 75 rods from the same source and
paid £4, 3s. 4d. 'to a certain smith in the Weald for
100 iron rods.'<a name="Anchor-80" id="Anchor-80"></a><a href="#Footnote-80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Wealden works had the advantage, a great
advantage in the case of so heavy a material as iron,
of nearness to London, and soon obtained a footing
in the London markets with the imported Spanish
iron at the expense of Gloucestershire, which at the
beginning of the reign of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> had been sending
its iron to Westminster and into Sussex.<a name="Anchor-81" id="Anchor-81"></a><a href="#Footnote-81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a> It must
not be imagined that the northern counties were
neglecting their mineral wealth all this time; they
were on the contrary very active, and were exploiting
their iron with vigour and success. On the lands of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Peter de Brus in Cleveland in 1271 there were five
small forges each valued at 10s., and two larger
worth £4 each:<a name="Anchor-82" id="Anchor-82"></a><a href="#Footnote-82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a> these sums may not sound very
imposing, but it must be borne in mind that the best
land in that district was then worth only 1s. an
acre. Twenty years later the forges belonging to
Furness Abbey yielded a profit of £6, 13s. 4d., as
compared with a profit on flocks and herds of only
£3, 11s. 3d., and it is probable that the Abbey had
at least forty forges then working on their lands.<a name="Anchor-83" id="Anchor-83"></a><a href="#Footnote-83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a>
The great quantity of iron obtained at Furness, also,
formed the most valuable part of the booty carried
off by the Scots in their raid in 1316.<a name="Anchor-84" id="Anchor-84"></a><a href="#Footnote-84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a> But the
large production of iron in the northern counties
was absorbed by their own local requirements, and
this was still more the case with the smaller quantities
smelted in Northamptonshire and Rutland. Derbyshire
must have been another important centre, for
as early as 1257 four or five forges in the Belper
ward of Duffield Frith were yielding about £10 each
yearly, and in 1314 two forges in Belper accounted
for £63, 6s. 8d. in thirty-four weeks, and there was
a third, yielding nearly £7, 10s. for only eleven
weeks' work,<a name="Anchor-85" id="Anchor-85"></a><a href="#Footnote-85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a> but there is nothing to show that
Derbyshire iron was ever sent south, and from the
middle of the fourteenth century such English iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>as was used in London was almost entirely drawn
from the Weald.</p>

<p>In order to understand how Sussex and Kent,
where no iron has been worked for the last hundred
years, came to be the centres of a great iron industry
in medieval times, it must be borne in mind that
charcoal was the only fuel used for iron working<a name="Anchor-86" id="Anchor-86"></a><a href="#Footnote-86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a>
until Dud Dudley discovered a method of using pit
coal, about 1620, a date which may be considered to
mark the end of the medieval period in iron mining.
The earliest and most primitive method of smelting
iron was by setting a hearth of wood and charcoal
on a wind-swept hill or in some other draughty
position, heaping upon it alternate layers of ore and
charcoal, and covering the whole with clay, to retain
the heat, leaving vents at the base for the wind to
enter and the iron to come out.<a name="Anchor-87" id="Anchor-87"></a><a href="#Footnote-87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a> A slight advance
on this substituted a short cylindrical furnace of
stone for the containing layer of clay, and an ingenious
device for increasing the draught was used
by the Romans at Lanchester, in Durham, where
two narrow tunnels were made on the side of a hill,
with wide mouths facing to the west, the quarter
from which the wind blows most frequently in this
valley, tapering to a narrow bore at the hearth.<a name="Anchor-88" id="Anchor-88"></a><a href="#Footnote-88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>Even under the most favourable conditions such a
furnace would reduce a very small percentage of
the ore to metal,<a name="Anchor-89" id="Anchor-89"></a><a href="#Footnote-89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a> and the use of an auxiliary blast,
produced by bellows, must have been resorted to at
a quite early date. Prior to the fifteenth century
such bellows were almost invariably worked by
hand, or rather by foot, for the blowers stood upon
the bellows, holding on to a bar, but during the
fifteenth century water power was introduced in
many parts of the country, and the bellows were
driven by water-wheels. Such was apparently
the case in Weardale in 1408,<a name="Anchor-90" id="Anchor-90"></a><a href="#Footnote-90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> probably in the Forest
of Dean about the same date, and clearly in Derbyshire
by the end of the century.<a name="Anchor-91" id="Anchor-91"></a><a href="#Footnote-91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a></p>

<p>In several early charters granting mineral rights
to Furness Abbey, mention is made of the privilege
of using water from the grantor's streams; but where
particulars are given, as in the case of the charter of
Hugh de Moresby made in 1270, the water is always
stated to be for the washing of the ore, and not for
power.<a name="Anchor-92" id="Anchor-92"></a><a href="#Footnote-92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a> The ore, or 'mine,' to use the more common
medieval term, was sometimes dug on the 'open-cast'
system, but more usually by a series of bell or beehive
pits.<a name="Anchor-93" id="Anchor-93"></a><a href="#Footnote-93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> It was then roughly cleansed by washing on a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>coarse sieve, and was next subjected to a preliminary
burning, or 'elyng,'<a name="Anchor-94" id="Anchor-94"></a><a href="#Footnote-94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a> as it was termed at the Tudeley
forge in the fourteenth century.<a name="Anchor-95" id="Anchor-95"></a><a href="#Footnote-95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> The burnt ore was
then broken and carried to the furnace. In the
sixteenth century this was a building in the shape of
a truncated cone, about twenty-four feet in diameter,
and not more than thirty feet high, in the base of
which was a cupped, or bowl-shaped, hearth of
sandstone, and such we may assume the earlier
furnaces also to have been. Alternate charges of
mine and charcoal were fed into the furnace from
the top, the iron settling down into the bowl of
the hearth, from which it was taken as a lump
or 'bloom.' From the sixteenth century, when
by the use of a more powerful blast a higher
temperature was obtainable and cast iron was
produced, the molten iron was drawn off from time
to time through a vent at the bottom of the hearth
into a bed of sand. In Sussex and Gloucestershire
it seems to have been usual to form in the sand one
large oblong depression in the direct course of the
flow of the iron with a number of smaller depressions
at right angles to the first, the large mass of iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>thus moulded being known as a 'sow,' and the
smaller blocks as 'pigs.'</p>

<p>There were in the earlier periods of the industry
a very large number of smelting hearths, consisting
practically of an ordinary blacksmith's forge with
a cup-shaped hearth, or crucible, in the bottom of
which the imperfectly molten iron accumulated.
Such were the itinerant forges (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fabricæ errantes</i>) in
the Forest of Dean, of which there were as many as
sixty in blast at the end of the thirteenth century.<a name="Anchor-96" id="Anchor-96"></a><a href="#Footnote-96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a>
The buildings attached to such a forge would naturally
be merely temporary sheds, such as were referred
to by the Earl of Richmond in 1281, when he gave
leave to the monks of Jervaux to cut wood in his
forest to smelt iron and to make two small sheds
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">logias</i>) 'without nail, bolt, or wall,' so that if the
smelters moved to another place (as these itinerant
forges did when the ore or the fuel became exhausted)
they should pull down the sheds and erect others.<a name="Anchor-97" id="Anchor-97"></a><a href="#Footnote-97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a>
In this instance the grant of two sheds may imply
two smelting-houses, but it seems more probable
that one was the 'bloomery,' or smelting forge, and
the other the smithy, which invariably accompanied
the bloomery.<a name="Anchor-98" id="Anchor-98"></a><a href="#Footnote-98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> With this simple type of forge the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>product was a lump of malleable iron, which was
purified by hammering and worked up at the smithy,
but the pig iron produced by the larger high blast
furnace required more elaborate treatment. The
sow was carried from the furnace to the forge,
'finery' or 'strynghearth,' where it was heated on
an open hearth and reduced by the sledge, or by the
water-hammer<a name="Anchor-99" id="Anchor-99"></a><a href="#Footnote-99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> when available, to a large ingot or
'bloom.'<a name="Anchor-100" id="Anchor-100"></a><a href="#Footnote-100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a> The latter was, as a rule, reheated,
divided and worked into bars, the completion of
which was usually carried out in the seventeenth
century at a third hearth, the 'chafery,' but this
appears to have been an elaboration of post-medieval
date. The sows naturally varied in size according
to the capacity of the furnace, and this, it may be
observed, was much greater at the end of a 'blowing'
than at the beginning, owing to the fire eating away
the hearth, especially if too large a proportion of
intractable 'hot' ore were used;<a name="Anchor-101" id="Anchor-101"></a><a href="#Footnote-101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> but the blooms
were made of standard weight. At the same time
the weight of the bloom, though constant in any
given district, varied in different parts of the country.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>In Weardale it seems to have been about two hundredweight,
being composed of fifteen stones, each of
thirteen pounds;<a name="Anchor-102" id="Anchor-102"></a><a href="#Footnote-102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a> and in Furness it was about the
same weight, but contained fourteen stones of fourteen
pounds.<a name="Anchor-103" id="Anchor-103"></a><a href="#Footnote-103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a> On the other hand, we find blooms
selling at the Kentish ironworks of Tudeley for
3s. 4d. in the reign of Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>,<a name="Anchor-104" id="Anchor-104"></a><a href="#Footnote-104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> when iron bought
for repairs to Leeds Castle cost about 7s. the hundredweight,<a name="Anchor-105" id="Anchor-105"></a><a href="#Footnote-105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a>
which, allowing for cost of carriage, agrees
fairly well with the three quarters of a hundredweight
attributed to the Sussex bloom in the seventeenth
century.<a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a><a href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> As regards the price of iron, it
was always high during the medieval period, but
naturally varied with conditions of demand and
supply, cost of carriage, and the quality of the
iron. To take a late instance: in Staffordshire in
1583, 'coldshear,' or brittle iron, fetched only £9
the ton when tough iron fetched £12.<a name="Anchor-107" id="Anchor-107"></a><a href="#Footnote-107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> In Sussex<a name="Anchor-108" id="Anchor-108"></a><a href="#Footnote-108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 108.">[108]</a>
in 1539 iron sold on the spot for from £5 to £7 the
ton, allowing a profit of 20s. the ton, and ten years
later £8 at the forge and about £9, 5s. in London,
the cost of carriage to London being 9s. the ton.<a name="Anchor-109" id="Anchor-109"></a><a href="#Footnote-109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 109.">[109]</a></p>

<p>The number of workmen employed at the different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>works naturally varied, but the surveyor of the iron
mills in Ashdown Forest in 1539 laid down the rule:<a name="Anchor-110" id="Anchor-110"></a><a href="#Footnote-110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 110.">[110]</a>
'That to melt the sowes in ij forges or fynories there
must be iiij persones, and at the forge to melt the
blomes there must be ij persones. So are there at
every forge ij persones wherof the oone holdeth the
work at the hamo<sup>r</sup> and the second kepeth the work
hot. M<sup>d</sup> that oone man cannot kepe the hamo<sup>r</sup>
bicause the work must be kept in such hete that
they may not shifte handes.'</p>

<p>At the Bedburn forge in 1408,<a name="Anchor-111" id="Anchor-111"></a><a href="#Footnote-111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a> there were a
'blomer' or 'smythman,' a smith and a foreman,
as well as a 'colier' or charcoal burner. The
blomer was paid 6d. for every bloom smelted, of
which the average production was six in a week, the
largest output recorded in any week being ten
blooms. For working up the bloom at the forge,
the smith received 6d. and an extra penny for
cutting it up into bars, while the foreman, who in
spite of his name does not seem to have had any
staff of workmen under him, received 2d. a bloom
when he assisted at the smelting, and 3d. at the
reworking. Such additional labour as was required
was supplied by the wives of the smith and foreman,
who did odd jobs, breaking up the ore, attending to
the bellows, or helping their husbands, earning wages
paid at first on a vague but rather high scale, but
falling afterwards to the settled rate of a halfpenny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>a bloom. An allowance of one penny a week was
made for ale for the workmen; and a similar munificent
allowance was made 'for drink for the four
blowers' at Tudeley in 1353.<a name="Anchor-112" id="Anchor-112"></a><a href="#Footnote-112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a> At this Tudeley
forge in 1333, the workmen were paid in kind,
receiving every seventh bloom,<a name="Anchor-113" id="Anchor-113"></a><a href="#Footnote-113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> a payment roughly
equivalent to 6d. a bloom, but by 1353 this system
had been dropped, and they were paid from 7½d. to
9½d. a bloom. In addition to the 'seventh bloom,'
we find mention in 1333 of a customary payment
to the 'Forblouweris'<a name="Anchor-114" id="Anchor-114"></a><a href="#Footnote-114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> of 2¼d. a bloom, and in the
1353 account we find 'rewards' paid to the master
blower and three other blowers; no other workmen
are mentioned by name, and as the whole process
of making the blooms is here referred to as 'blowyng'
we may probably assume that the staff of these
Kentish works consisted of four men. The Sussex
iron mills at Sheffield in Fletching in 1549 employed
one hammerman and his assistant,<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a><a href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> two fyners and
their two servants, a founder, and a filler,<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a><a href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> the
business of the latter being to keep the furnace
charged. Here the founder was paid 8s., and the
filler 6s. for each 'foundye,' or working week of six
days, and the hammerman and fyners received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>between them 13s. 4d. a ton, about three tons being
produced each 'foundye.'</p>

<p>In addition to the actual ironworkers every forge
afforded employment to a number of charcoal-burners
and miners. For the most part these latter,
as was the case with the coal miners, ranked as
ordinary labourers, but in the Forest of Dean they
formed a close corporation of 'free miners,' possessing
an organisation and privileges of considerable importance
and antiquity.<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a><a href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> So far as can be judged
the customs of the free miners were traditional,
based on prescription, recognised as early as the time
of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>, and officially confirmed by Edward <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr>
By these customs the right of mining was restricted
to the free miners resident within the bounds of the
Forest, and they had also control of the export of
the iron ore, all persons carrying the same down the
Severn being bound to pay dues to the miners under
penalty of forfeiture of their boat. The free miners
had also the right of digging anywhere within the
Forest, except in gardens, orchards, and curtilages;
the lord of the soil, who might be the king or a
private landowner, being entitled to a share as a
member of the fellowship, almost always consisting
of four 'verns' or partners. Besides the right
thus to open a mine the miners had a claim to access
thereto from the highway, and to timber for their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>works. In return, the king received from every
miner who raised three loads of ore in a week one
penny, which was collected by the 'gaveller' every
Tuesday 'between Mattens and Masse,' and he had
also the right to certain quantities of 'law-ore'
from the different mines every week, for which the
miners were paid at the rate of a penny a load, and
if he was working an itinerant forge they were bound
to supply ore therefor at the same rate, and finally
there was a royal export duty of a halfpenny on every
load of ore taken out of the Forest.<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a><a href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a></p>

<p>The right of mining within the forest was restricted,
as we have already said, to the resident free miners,
and they might only employ the labour of their own
family or apprentices. These rights to their mines,
or shares therein, were definite, and could be bequeathed
by will; and in order to prevent trespass
the rule was laid down that no man should start a
fresh working near that of another miner 'within
so much space that the miner may stand and cast
ridding<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a><a href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> and stones so far from him with a bale, as
the manner is.' When disputes arose between the
miners, they were settled at their own court, held
every three weeks at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Briavels, under the presidency
of the Constable, appeals being made, if necessary,
from the normal jury of twelve miners to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>juries of twenty-four or forty-eight. These Mine
Law Courts continued to be held until the latter
half of the eighteenth century; but we are not here
concerned with their later proceedings and constant
endeavours to maintain restrictions which had long
passed out of date; endeavours which seem to have
resulted chiefly in promoting 'the abominable sin
of perjury,' so that it was found necessary to ordain
that any miner convicted thereof should be expelled
and 'all the working tooles and habitt burned before
his face.' What those tools and costume were in
the fifteenth century, and until modern times, may
be seen on a brass in Newland Church, whereon is
depicted a free miner wearing a cap and leather
breeches tied below the knee, with a wooden mine-hod
slung over his shoulder, carrying a small mattock
in his right hand, and holding a candlestick between
his teeth.<a name="Anchor-120" id="Anchor-120"></a><a href="#Footnote-120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a></p>

<p>Although not so intimately connected with iron
working as the smiths, smelters and miners, the
charcoal-burners were auxiliaries without whom
the industry could not have existed, and who in
turn derived their living largely from that industry.
The amount of wood consumed by the iron works
was enormous. As an example we may take the
case of the two Sussex mills of Sheffield and Worth
for 1547-9.<a name="Anchor-121" id="Anchor-121"></a><a href="#Footnote-121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a> At Sheffield 6300 cords of wood were
'coled' for the furnace, and 6750 cords for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>forge; at Worth the amounts were respectively
nearly 5900 and 2750 cords; the cords being 125
cubic feet, this represents an expenditure of about
2,175,000 cubic feet of timber for these two works
alone in less than two years. Later, in 1580, it
was stated that a beech tree of one foot square 'at
the stubbe' would make one and a half loads of
charcoal, and the ironworks at Monkswood, near
Tintern, would require 600 such trees every year,<a name="Anchor-122" id="Anchor-122"></a><a href="#Footnote-122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a>
while some thirty years later Norden referred to
the fact that there were in Sussex alone about 140
forges using two, three, or four loads of charcoal
apiece daily. Acts were passed in 1558, 1581, and
1585 regulating the cutting of wood for furnaces
and prohibiting the use of timber trees for charcoal,
but they were evaded, and the destruction of trees
continued until in the eighteenth century charcoal
was supplanted by mineral coal, the first successful
use of which for iron smelting, by Dud Dudley
in 1620, marks, as we have said, the termination
of the medieval period.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr><br />

<small>MINING—LEAD AND SILVER</small></h2>


<p>The lead-mining industry in England is important
and interesting from its antiquity, the value of its
produce, large quantities of silver being obtained
from this source during the medieval period, and the
organisation of its workers. Although lacking the
completeness of organisation which rendered the
tinners of Cornwall and Devon almost an independent
race, the lead miners of Alston Moor, Derbyshire,
and the Mendips, the three great mining camps of
England, were more highly organised than the iron
miners of Dean, who form the lowest class of privileged
'free miners.'</p>

<p>The lead mines of Britain were worked by the
Romans from the earliest days of their occupation
of the island, pigs of lead having been found in the
Mendips stamped with the titles of Britannicus
(<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 44-48) and Claudius (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 49).<a name="Anchor-123" id="Anchor-123"></a><a href="#Footnote-123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> Mines of this
period exist at Shelve and Snailbeach in Shropshire
and elsewhere, and smelting-hearths have been found
at Minsterley in the same county and at Matlock.<a name="Anchor-124" id="Anchor-124"></a><a href="#Footnote-124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Nor was the industry discontinued after the departure
of the Romans. Lead mines at Wirksworth in
Derbyshire were leased by the Abbess of Repton to
a certain Duke Humbert in 835,<a name="Anchor-125" id="Anchor-125"></a><a href="#Footnote-125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> and a 'leadgedelf'
at Penpark Hole in Gloucestershire is mentioned in
882,<a name="Anchor-126" id="Anchor-126"></a><a href="#Footnote-126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a> though that county was not a great centre of
lead production at a later date. In the time of
Edward the Confessor the Derbyshire mines of
Bakewell, Ashford, and Hope yielded £30, besides
five wainloads of lead, but in 1086 their yearly value
had fallen, for some reason, to £10, 6s. Besides these
three mines Domesday Book alludes to others at
Wirksworth, Metesford, and Crich.<a name="Anchor-127" id="Anchor-127"></a><a href="#Footnote-127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a></p>

<p>During the twelfth century the output of lead was
considerable. The 'mines of Carlisle,' that is to
say of Alston Moor, on the borders of Cumberland,
Yorkshire, and Northumberland, occur on the Pipe
Roll of 1130, and were farmed during the reign of
Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr><a name="Anchor-128" id="Anchor-128"></a><a href="#Footnote-128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a> at an average rent of £100; during the
same reign large quantities of lead from Derbyshire
were carried across to Boston and shipped to London
and the Continent: the Shropshire mines were also
active, one hundred and ten loads of lead being sent
down to Amesbury in 1181 alone. King Stephen
granted to the Bishop of Durham certain mines in
Weardale, probably of silver-bearing lead, as the
non-precious minerals already belonged to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>bishopric, and during the vacancy of the see of
Durham in 1196 considerable issues of silver were
accounted for.<a name="Anchor-129" id="Anchor-129"></a><a href="#Footnote-129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> A similar grant of lead mines in
Somerset was made to Bishop Reginald of Bath by
Richard <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>.<a name="Anchor-130" id="Anchor-130"></a><a href="#Footnote-130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a> How soon the three great mining camps
acquired their privileges and organisation cannot be
definitely stated: some of the regulations seem to
have been traditional from very early times, even in
the case of the Mendip mines, of which the laws
were largely based upon the Derbyshire code. So
far as the northern mines are concerned, we find
Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> in 1235 confirming to the miners of Alston
the liberties and privileges 'which they used to
have.'<a name="Anchor-131" id="Anchor-131"></a><a href="#Footnote-131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a></p>

<p>Of the regulations in force at Alston Moor<a name="Anchor-132" id="Anchor-132"></a><a href="#Footnote-132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a> we
have but few details, but of the laws of Derbyshire<a name="Anchor-133" id="Anchor-133"></a><a href="#Footnote-133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a>
and the Mendips<a name="Anchor-134" id="Anchor-134"></a><a href="#Footnote-134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a> we have ample information. In
each case there was a mine court, known in Derbyshire
as the 'berghmote' or 'barmote,' of which
the ordinary meetings were held every three weeks
and special sessions twice a year, at Easter and
Michaelmas. The 'body of the court' consisted of
twelve, or in the 'great courts' twenty-four, miners
of good standing and the presiding officer was in
Derbyshire the barmaster and in Somerset the lead-reeve:
at Alston<a name="Anchor-135" id="Anchor-135"></a><a href="#Footnote-135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> he appears as bailiff, 'king's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>serjeant,' and steward. Associated with this
official was the coroner:<a name="Anchor-136" id="Anchor-136"></a><a href="#Footnote-136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> the two offices indeed
seem to have been combined at Alston during the
thirteenth century as in 1279 complaint was made
that the coroners of the Scottish king's liberty of
Tindale (that portion of the present county of
Northumberland which adjoins Alston Moor) were
acting in the mine 'where the serjeant of the mine
appointed by the English king ought to exercise
the office of coroner in all things':<a name="Anchor-137" id="Anchor-137"></a><a href="#Footnote-137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> by 1356, however,
it was the custom for the Alston miners to
elect a coroner separate from the bailiff or king's
serjeant.<a name="Anchor-138" id="Anchor-138"></a><a href="#Footnote-138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a> The exact degree of independence
possessed by these mine courts is difficult to determine.
During eyres in Cumberland it was customary
to send special justices to Alston to hold the
pleas of the Crown. This was already an old-established
custom in 1246,<a name="Anchor-139" id="Anchor-139"></a><a href="#Footnote-139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a> and we find that Robert
de Vipont, who about the beginning of the reign of
Edward <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr> had formed a manor out of what had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>been moor and waste, had usurped the right to try
thieves in his manor court, when they ought only
to be tried in the mine court.<a name="Anchor-140" id="Anchor-140"></a><a href="#Footnote-140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a> Even in Derbyshire
there was a tendency to use the courts of the Duchy
of Lancaster instead of, or to overrule, the mine
courts, at least in the sixteenth century.<a name="Anchor-141" id="Anchor-141"></a><a href="#Footnote-141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a></p>

<p>By the Derbyshire mine law a small trespass was
punishable by a fine of 2d., but if this was not paid
at once the fine was doubled each successive day
until it reached the sum of 5s. 4d. This same sum
of 5s. 4d. (doubled in a similar way up to 100s.) was
the fine for bloodshed, or for the offence of encroaching
upon another man's claim underground. For a
thrice-repeated theft of ore the offender's hand
was pinned with a knife to the uprights of his windlass,
and if he succeeded in getting free he had to
forswear the mine for ever. A similarly savage
and primitive measure of justice was meted out to
the Mendip miner who stole lead worth 13½d.: his
property was forfeited, and the bailiff was to bring
him 'where hys howse or wore [<i>i.e.</i> ore] hys, hys work
and towlls with all instruments belongyng to that
occupacyon and then put hym in hys howss or working
place and set fyer yn all together about hym—banyshe
hym from that occupacyon for ever by
fore the face of all the myners there.' Both methods
of punishment are clearly of early origin, and it
seems probable that they originally involved the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>death of the thief, though a later and more humane
generation connived at his escape while retaining
the ancient form of punishment. If the burnt
thief did not dread the fire, but returned and stole
again, he was handed over to the sheriff's officers
and committed to prison, being no longer one of the
privileged community. It is worth noting that the
great mining camp on the borders of Cornwall and
Devon, though not apparently possessing any mine
court, had, as we might expect, certain control over
the excesses of the miners, as in 1302 there was
made 'a pit in the mine by way of prison to frighten
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad terrorem</i>) evildoers and bad workmen.'<a name="Anchor-142" id="Anchor-142"></a><a href="#Footnote-142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a> The
Devon miner, as we have just said, had no code of
laws or privileges; at Alston the code applied only
to the miners actually living in the collection of
'shiels,' or huts on the Moor; in Derbyshire the full
system of regulations was confined to the royal
'field,' though a few private owners of mining
fields established barmotes on similar lines;<a name="Anchor-143" id="Anchor-143"></a><a href="#Footnote-143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> but
the customs of the Mendips appear to have applied
throughout the district, whoever might be lord of
the soil.</p>

<p>By mining law the miner had the right to prospect
anywhere except in churchyards, gardens, orchards,
and highways; on the Mendips, however, he had
first to go through the formality of asking leave of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>the lord of the soil, or of his lead-reeve, who could
not refuse their permission; he might then pitch
where he pleased and break ground as he thought
best. In Derbyshire, when the prospector had struck
a promising 'rake' or vein, he cut a cross in the
ground and went to the barmaster, who came and
staked out the claim into 'meers,' each being four
perches of twenty-four feet: the first two meers
were given to the finder, the third to the king, as
lord of the soil, and the others to those miners who
first demanded them. Within three days the owner
of a meer must set up a 'stow,'<a name="Anchor-144" id="Anchor-144"></a><a href="#Footnote-144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> a wooden frame with
two uprights joined by a bar or spindle placed at the
top of the shaft, and serving as a windlass. If the
claim was not then worked, the barmaster nicked the
spindle, and if this were done three times, and the
claim was still unworked, it was declared forfeit
and granted to the first applicant. The regulations
in use on the Mendip field were rather different.
There the pitches or claims, instead of being of one
standard size, were decided by the throw of the
'hack' or small pick, weighing 3 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> 14 oz. 'Every
man when he doth begyn hys pyt, otherwyse callyd
a grouff, shaull have hys haks throw ij weys after
the rake,<a name="Anchor-145" id="Anchor-145"></a><a href="#Footnote-145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> so that he do stand to the gyrdyl or wast
in the gruff'; while this decided the limits of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>pitch along the line of the vein the pitcher had always
eighteen feet on either side of his 'grooffe or gribbe.'
The hack, however, was not thrown unless another
party wished to pitch in the neighbourhood; in
that case the newcomer, or 'younger pitcher,' could
demand that the hack be thrown by the 'elder
pitcher' and his partners, 'when they have their
chine, rake or course,' that is to say, when they have
struck the vein. The lead-reeve then proffered the
hack to one of the elder pitchers, and if they failed
to throw it within fourteen days the younger pitcher
had the throw.<a name="Anchor-146" id="Anchor-146"></a><a href="#Footnote-146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> The rules for reserving a claim
were probably founded on those in use in Derbyshire.
'The first pytcher in any grounde muste
make yt perfecte wyth a caddel of tymber and a
payre of styllyngs within fowre and twentie howers
next after the pyching.' Although this was the
strict law, custom seems to have been content with
the making of the 'caddel,' some sort of framework
of timber, the first day, and to have allowed a month
for the 'styllyngs,' or stow. If a claim lay unworked
for four weeks, the lead-reeve caused proclamation
to be made, and if the old partners did not
turn up within fourteen days, it was forfeited.</p>

<p>Besides the right of prospecting where they chose,
the miners had right of access to the nearest high-road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>and in Derbyshire if this were refused them the
barmaster and two assistants might walk abreast
with arms stretched out, and so mark out a way
direct from the mines to the road, even through
growing corn. They were also privileged to take
timber from the neighbouring woods for use in the
mines, and in Cumberland, where fuel was scarce,
they might even prevent the owners of the woods
from cutting them until they had obtained a sufficient
supply for the furnaces. Their proprietary
rights in their mines were recognised, and they
could dispose of them, wholly or in part, without
licence. They might also take their ore to what
'myndry' they pleased, to be smelted, and the only
restriction upon the sale of the ore or lead was that
in some places the king, or other lord of the soil,
had 'coup,' that is to say pre-emption, the right of
buying the ore at the market price before it was
offered to any other purchaser, and in 1295 we find
the Derbyshire miners paying 4d. a load in respect
of 'coup' for licence to sell to whom they pleased.<a name="Anchor-147" id="Anchor-147"></a><a href="#Footnote-147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a></p>

<p>The terms upon which the miners held their
mines varied. On private lands, when the owner
did not work the mines himself by hired labour, he
usually bargained for some proportion, an eighth,
a tenth, or a thirteenth, of the produce. On the
Mendips the lord of the soil received the tenth part
as 'lot'; on the royal field of Derbyshire the king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>had the thirteenth, and at Alston the ninth dish of
ore, the dish in the latter case being 'as much ore
as a strong man can lift from the ground.'<a name="Anchor-148" id="Anchor-148"></a><a href="#Footnote-148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a> At
Alston the king had in addition the fifteenth penny
from the other eight dishes, but had to provide at
his own expense a man called 'the driver,' who
understood how to separate the silver from the lead.<a name="Anchor-149" id="Anchor-149"></a><a href="#Footnote-149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a>
This method of paying a proportion of the produce
was clearly the fairest to all concerned, for, as the
Cumberland miners said in 1278, though they knew
that there was ore enough to last to the end of time,
no one could tell the yearly value of the mines, as
it depended upon the richness of the ore they struck,<a name="Anchor-150" id="Anchor-150"></a><a href="#Footnote-150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a>
and in the same way when Robert de Thorp was
made warden of the Devon mines in 1308,<a name="Anchor-151" id="Anchor-151"></a><a href="#Footnote-151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a> it was
expressly stated that no definite sum was to be
demanded of him, because the silver-bearing ore,
the refined lead, and the reworked slag all had
'diversetez de bonntez et quantitez de respouns.'
In addition to the payment of lot ore, the miners
had to give tithes to the Church. In some cases
these tithes originated in a definite grant, more
often they seem to have been regarded as compensation
for the tithes of crops which would otherwise
have grown on the ground taken by the mines; but
the strangest reason for claiming them was that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>lead was itself a titheable crop, because it 'grew
and renewed in the veins.'<a name="Anchor-152" id="Anchor-152"></a><a href="#Footnote-152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a></p>

<p>While many small mines were worked by parties
of free miners under these conditions, for their own
profit, and at their own risk, there must have been
from very early times a large number of poor men
who worked for the king, the lord of the soil, or
capitalist adventurers, receiving wages either by
piece or by time. The regulations for the payment
of these hired miners in the royal mines of Beer
Alston, in Devonshire, drawn up in 1297 are of
considerable interest.<a name="Anchor-153" id="Anchor-153"></a><a href="#Footnote-153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a></p>

<p>'As to the piecework of the miners, those who can
find ore in their diggings shall receive for piecework
as before, that is to say 5s. for the load,<a name="Anchor-154" id="Anchor-154"></a><a href="#Footnote-154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> as well
of black as of white ore, if the white cannot reasonably
be put lower. And those who are engaged in
"dead" [<i>i.e.</i> unremunerative] work, and cannot find
ore in their diggings, and yet work more, for some
dead work is harder than (digging in) the vein, shall
be at wages (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a lour soutz</i>) until they reach the ore,
so that all piecework be undertaken by two or three
gangs who divide the profits between themselves, as
well to those doing dead work as to the others.'</p>

<p>That the price of 5s. a load was calculated to pay
the miners for their preliminary unproductive 'dead'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>work, may be gathered from the fact that 'tithe ore,'
that is to say the ore paid to the Church, was bought
back from the rector of Beer at 2s. the load, and a
further 9d. was deducted from this sum for washing
the ore.<a name="Anchor-155" id="Anchor-155"></a><a href="#Footnote-155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> At the same time it is clear that where
the 'dead' work was exceptionally heavy or the
eventual yield small this system of payment would
not work; and in 1323 we find that the 'dead work'
of clearing, searching, and digging into an old mine
in Devon was paid at the rate of 3s. 4d. the fathom,
and that two gangs of six men were paid at the
daily rate of 7d.-9d., about 1½d. a head, for searching
for the vein and for piercing the hard rock to follow
up the vein in hope of finding a richer vein.<a name="Anchor-156" id="Anchor-156"></a><a href="#Footnote-156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a></p>

<p>By the Ordinance of 1297 wages were to be paid
every Saturday, though as a matter of fact we find
that they were constantly falling into arrears.</p>

<p>'All the ore of each week shall be measured before
the Saturday and carried to the boles or other places
where it is to be smelted. And knowledge shall
be taken each Saturday or Sunday of the issues
of each week in all things. And the payments shall
be made to the miners and other workmen the same
Saturday. And no miner shall remain in a market
town under colour of buying food, or in other manner
after the ninth hour on Sunday, without leave.'</p>

<p>Besides their wages the miners received such
iron, steel, and ropes as they required, free of charge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>and had the use of a forge for the repair of their
tools.<a name="Anchor-157" id="Anchor-157"></a><a href="#Footnote-157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a> At Beer, in 1297, there were three forges,
one for each of the three mines into which the field
was divided,<a name="Anchor-158" id="Anchor-158"></a><a href="#Footnote-158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> and each worked by a man and a boy.
In addition to the smiths<a name="Anchor-159" id="Anchor-159"></a><a href="#Footnote-159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 159.">[159]</a> there would be, as auxiliaries,
one or more candlemakers, carpenters, charcoal-burners,
and woodcutters. In many mines it
was also necessary to employ a number of hands in
baling water out of the pits with leathern bodges or
buckets; during April 1323 an average of twenty
persons were so engaged at Beer Alston, and during
one week the number rose to forty-eight.<a name="Anchor-160" id="Anchor-160"></a><a href="#Footnote-160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 160.">[160]</a> So
greatly did the accumulation of water in the pits
interfere with work, that in early times the Devon
mines were closed down during the winter,<a name="Anchor-161" id="Anchor-161"></a><a href="#Footnote-161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 161.">[161]</a> and it
was not until about 1297 that means were found of
dealing with this evil. About that date the plan
of draining the pits by means of 'avidods' or
adits, that is to say horizontal galleries driven from
the bottom of the pits to a level of free drainage
on the surface, already in use in the tin mines, was
introduced into the lead mines. The ordinances
of 1297 arranged for one hundred tinners to work
in 'avidods,' and the accounts of the working of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>these mines for the same year show payments
averaging £12, 10s. to 'William Pepercorn and his
partners,' and to six other gangs 'for making
avidods.'<a name="Anchor-162" id="Anchor-162"></a><a href="#Footnote-162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 162.">[162]</a> It was probably in the following year
that Walter de Langton, Bishop of Chester, reported
that the yield of the Beer mine had been doubled
by the new method of draining, as they could now
work as well in the winter as in the summer.<a name="Anchor-163" id="Anchor-163"></a><a href="#Footnote-163" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 163.">[163]</a></p>

<p>The ore having been raised was broken up with
a hammer, no mechanical stamps being used apparently
before the sixteenth century, if then, though
there is mention in 1302 of a machine (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingenium</i>) for
breaking 'black work' or slag.<a name="Anchor-164" id="Anchor-164"></a><a href="#Footnote-164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 164.">[164]</a> It was then
washed in 'buddles' or troughs, with the aid of
coarse sieves, women being frequently employed for
this process. The washed ore, separated as far as
possible from stone and other impurities, was then
carried to the smelting furnace. The commonest
type of furnace was the 'bole,' a rough stone structure
like a limekiln, with an opening at the top,
serving as a chimney, and also for charging the
furnace, and one or more vents at the base for the
blast. These boles were usually built in exposed and
draughty positions, and could only be used when
the wind was favourable. At an early date they
were supplemented by 'slag-hearths' or furnaces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>(<i lang="it" xml:lang="it">fornelli</i>) possessing an artificial blast and closely
resembling blacksmiths' forges. The bellows of these
hearths were usually driven by the feet of men or
women, but a water mill was in use in Devon at least
as early as 1295,<a name="Anchor-165" id="Anchor-165"></a><a href="#Footnote-165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> and at Wolsingham, in Durham,
in 1426 water power was used when available, the
footblast being used during dry seasons.<a name="Anchor-166" id="Anchor-166"></a><a href="#Footnote-166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> The fuel
of the boles was brushwood, and that of the hearths
charcoal, with peat and, for the remelting of the
lead, sea-coal. In Devon mention is made of a
third type of smelting house, the 'hutte,' the nature
of which is obscure. The huttes are usually classed
with the boles;<a name="Anchor-167" id="Anchor-167"></a><a href="#Footnote-167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a> thus it was noted in 1297 that 'from
each load of black ore smelted at the huttes and
boles there come 3½ feet of silver-lead, each foot
containing 70 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of lead, each pound weighing
25s. sterling. And from a load of black ore smelted
by the mill furnace come 3 feet of silver-lead. And
from a load of white ore smelted by the furnace or
elsewhere come 1½ feet of silver-lead. Moreover a
pound of lead made from black ore smelted by the
boles and huttes and by their furnaces yields 2 <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr>
of silver; a pound of lead from black ore smelted
by the mill furnace yields 3 <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr> of silver; and a
pound made from white ore 1½ <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr>' In the same
way the 'black work' or slag of both boles and
huttes were reworked at the furnaces.<a name="Anchor-168" id="Anchor-168"></a><a href="#Footnote-168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a> A possible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>hint is found in the fact that large quantities of
refined lead had to be put into the hutte when it
was first lit,'as the huttes cannot burn ore or smelt
lead without the addition of sufficient melted lead
at the start to roast (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coquenda</i>) the ore in the lead
so added.'<a name="Anchor-169" id="Anchor-169"></a><a href="#Footnote-169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> This certainly suggests some sort of
cupellation furnaces. Yet another type of furnace
was the 'turn-hearth' used in the Mendips; the
construction of this, again, is obscure, but it seems
to have derived its name from some portion of the
hearth being movable and adjustable to changing
winds, while it would seem that the ordinary furnace
could only be used when the wind blew from a
particular quarter.<a name="Anchor-170" id="Anchor-170"></a><a href="#Footnote-170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a> There are references in 1302
to a '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fornellus versatilis</i>' used in the Devon mines,
and one entry speaks of making the furnace 'upon
the turning machine' (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">super ingenium versatile</i>).<a name="Anchor-171" id="Anchor-171"></a><a href="#Footnote-171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a></p>

<p>The bolers and furnacemen, who were paid about
12d. to 16d. a week, their assistants receiving about
half those amounts, having cast the lead into pigs
and stamped it, handed it over to the wardens of the
mine. The next process was the refining of the
silver from the lead by cupellation. When an alloy
of silver and lead is melted on an open hearth with
free access of air, the lead is oxidized and, in the
form of litharge, can be removed either by skimming
it off or by absorption by the porous body of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>hearth, leaving the silver in a more or less pure form.
By adding more lead and repeating the process the
silver can be further refined. In England it seems
to have been usual to remove the litharge by absorption;
in the case of the Romano-British refinery
at Silchester,<a name="Anchor-172" id="Anchor-172"></a><a href="#Footnote-172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> the absorbent material used was
bone ash, but in the medieval refineries at the Devon
mines charred 'tan turves,'<a name="Anchor-173" id="Anchor-173"></a><a href="#Footnote-173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a> or refuse blocks of oak
bark from the tanneries, were used, and probably
the same material was used in Derbyshire, the
southern mines being largely worked by Derbyshire
miners. A thick bed of this tan-ash was made with
a dished hollow in the middle, in which was placed
the fuel and the lead; the hearth was then fired
and blast supplied from the side: when the whole
was melted the fire was raked aside and the blast
turned on to the upper surface of the molten metal,
which was thus rapidly oxidized and so refined.</p>

<p>But first, as soon as the mass of silver-lead was in
a fluid state, 'before the ash has absorbed any of the
lead, the lead is to be stirred and mixed so that it is
of equal quality throughout, and a quantity of the
lead amounting to about 6s. weight shall be taken
out, and this shall be divided into two parts, half
being given to the refiner, ticketed with his name,
and the date and sealed by the wardens, and the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>half shall be assayed by the king's assayer in the
presence of the wardens and of the refiner, and the
refiner shall answer for the whole of that refining
at the rate of the assay, as nearly as is reasonable,
having regard to the fact that there is greater waste
and loss in the big operation of refining than in the
assay. And when the silver has been fully refined
it shall be given by the refiners to the wardens for a
tally (or receipt) of the weight, so that there shall be
neither suspicion nor deceit on either side....
And the lead that remains in the ash after the
refining shall be resmelted at a suitable time.'<a name="Anchor-174" id="Anchor-174"></a><a href="#Footnote-174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a>
These ordinances of 1297, just quoted, arranged for
there being five skilled refiners at the Devon mines,
and the account rolls show that they received from
18d. to 2s. a week.</p>

<p>The silver seems to have been cast into plates
or ingots varying from ten to twenty pounds in
weight and value (for the monetary pound was
simply the pound weight of standard silver). Its
purity probably varied, for while in 1296 the pound
of refined silver was mixed with 14d. of alloy to bring
it to the standard,<a name="Anchor-175" id="Anchor-175"></a><a href="#Footnote-175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a> a few years later silver weighing
£132, 5s. was worth only £131, 13s. 7¼d. in coined
money,<a name="Anchor-176" id="Anchor-176"></a><a href="#Footnote-176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a> and 370 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of silver sent up from Martinstowe
in 1294 had to be further refined in London
before it could be made into silver vessels for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>Countess of Barre.<a name="Anchor-177" id="Anchor-177"></a><a href="#Footnote-177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a> In the case of the lead we
have the usual medieval complexity of weights. An
early entry<a name="Anchor-178" id="Anchor-178"></a><a href="#Footnote-178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a> records that 'a carretate (or cartload) of
lead of the Peak contains 24 fotinels, each of 70 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>,
and the fotinel contains 14 cuts<a name="Anchor-179" id="Anchor-179"></a><a href="#Footnote-179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a> of 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> A carretate
of London is larger by 420 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>' The London
weight appears to have gained the day, as a later
entry gives 13½ <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> to a stone, 6 stones to a foot, and
30 feet (or 2430 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>) to a carretate 'according to the
weight of the Peak.'<a name="Anchor-180" id="Anchor-180"></a><a href="#Footnote-180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a> In Devon we find in 1297
carretates of 24 feet and 32 feet in use simultaneously,
the foot being 70 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> here as in Derbyshire.<a name="Anchor-181" id="Anchor-181"></a><a href="#Footnote-181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a></p>

<p>In no other part of England had the lead-mining
industry so continuous a history of steady prosperity
as in Derbyshire. The Devon mines seem to have
been richer and more productive during a short
period, but the half century, 1290-1340 practically
covers the period of their boom. During the five
years, 1292-1297, these mines produced £4046 of
silver, and about £360 worth of lead; next year the
silver amounted to £1450. Then in April 1299 the
king leased the mines to the Friscobaldi, Italian
merchants and money-lenders, with whom he had
many dealings.<a name="Anchor-182" id="Anchor-182"></a><a href="#Footnote-182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a> They agreed to pay 13s. 4d. a
load for the ore, but after about a year, during which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>time they drew some 3600 loads of ore,<a name="Anchor-183" id="Anchor-183"></a><a href="#Footnote-183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a> they found
that they were losing heavily, the ore not being
worth more than 10s. a load, and the costs of working
being higher than they had expected.<a name="Anchor-184" id="Anchor-184"></a><a href="#Footnote-184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a> The
mines, however, continued to yield well when
worked by the king for his own benefit, as much as
£1773 of silver and £180 from lead being obtained
in 1305: this, however, seems to have been the
highwater mark, the yield for 1347 being only
£70.<a name="Anchor-185" id="Anchor-185"></a><a href="#Footnote-185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a> After this the mines were let to private
adventurers from time to time; but such records as
we have do not suggest that many fortunes were
made from them: in 1426 the yield for the previous
two and a half years had been 39 ounces of silver,<a name="Anchor-186" id="Anchor-186"></a><a href="#Footnote-186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a>
for the year 1442 it was £17,<a name="Anchor-187" id="Anchor-187"></a><a href="#Footnote-187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a> but for the six years,
1445-51, the average output rose to 4000 ounces.<a name="Anchor-188" id="Anchor-188"></a><a href="#Footnote-188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a>
At the beginning of the boom, in 1295, it was found
necessary to recruit labour from the older lead-mining
districts, and commissioners were appointed to select
miners for Devon from Cheshire, Earl Warenne's
liberty of Bromfield in Shropshire, the Peak,
Gloucester, Somerset, and Dorset.<a name="Anchor-189" id="Anchor-189"></a><a href="#Footnote-189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> The ordinances
of 1297 stipulated for 150 miners from the
Peak, and an equal number of local men from Devon
and Cornwall, though the accounts show that there
were that year 384 miners from the Peak, and 35
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>from Wales.<a name="Anchor-190" id="Anchor-190"></a><a href="#Footnote-190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a> On the other hand, in 1296, while
we have over 300 miners coming from the Peak, a
twelve days' journey, we also find four picked men
sent from Devon to the king's court, and thence to
Ireland to prospect on the king's behalf.<a name="Anchor-191" id="Anchor-191"></a><a href="#Footnote-191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a></p>

<p>The prosperity of the Devon mines caused an
increase of activity in those of Somerset, where a
number of fresh strikes were reported during the
early years of the fourteenth century, about one of
which an optimistic lead reeve wrote to the Bishop
of Bath and Wells as follows:<a name="Anchor-192" id="Anchor-192"></a><a href="#Footnote-192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a>—</p>

<p>'Know, my lord, that your workmen have found
a splendid mine<a name="Anchor-193" id="Anchor-193"></a><a href="#Footnote-193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a> of lead on the Mendips to the east
of Priddy, and one that can be opened up with no
trouble, being only five or six feet below the ground.
And since these workmen are so often thieves,
craftily separating the silver from the lead, stealthily
taking it away, and when they have collected a
quantity fleeing like thieves and deserting their
work, as has frequently happened in times past,
therefore your bailiffs are causing the ore to be
carried to your court of Wookey where there is a
furnace built at which the workmen smelt the ore
under supervision of certain persons appointed by
your steward. And as the steward, bailiffs, and
workmen consider that there is a great deal of silver
in the lead, on account of its whiteness and sonority,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>they beg that you will send them as soon as possible
a good and faithful workman upon whom they can
rely. I have seen the first piece of lead smelted
there, of great size and weight, which when it is
struck rings almost like silver, wherefore I agree
with the others that if it is faithfully worked the
business should prove of immense value to yourself
and to the neighbourhood, and if a reliable workman
is obtained I think that it would be expedient to
smelt the ore where it is dug, on account of the
labour of carrying so heavy material such a distance.
The ore is in grains like sand.'</p>

<p>There is no evidence that this mine fulfilled the sanguine
expectations of its discoverers, but about the
same time, in 1314, we find Herman de Alemannia
and other adventurers working a mine in Brushford,
near Dulverton.<a name="Anchor-194" id="Anchor-194"></a><a href="#Footnote-194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a> The Germans were for many
centuries the most skilled miners, and English mining
owes much to their enterprise. As an instance of their
greater skill we may take the case of Thomas de
Alemaigne, silver finer,<a name="Anchor-195" id="Anchor-195"></a><a href="#Footnote-195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> who being out of work
petitioned the king to grant him the refuse and slag
(<i>les aftirwas et les remisailles</i>) thrown aside at the
mines in Devonshire, which had been refined so far
as those at the mines could refine them: no one
else would touch them, so the king would get no
gain unless he granted them to Thomas, who was
willing to pay 20s. a year for the right to rework
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>them. This same Thomas de Alemaigne was
appointed in 1324 to dig, cleanse, and examine the
king's mines in Cumberland and Westmoreland.<a name="Anchor-196" id="Anchor-196"></a><a href="#Footnote-196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a>
Probably these mines had not been worked for some
time previous, as in 1292 the total issues of the
Alston mines for the last fourteen years were said
to have been £4, 0s. 2d., possibly owing to the
absence of fuel, which is given as the reason for an
iron mine there being worth only 15s. a year.<a name="Anchor-197" id="Anchor-197"></a><a href="#Footnote-197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a>
Later, in 1359, Tilman de Cologne was farming the
Alston mines, and in 1475, as a result apparently
of a report by George Willarby<a name="Anchor-198" id="Anchor-198"></a><a href="#Footnote-198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a> that there were
in the north of England three notable mines, one
containing 27 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of silver to the fodder of lead
with a vein half a rod broad, another 18 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> with
a vein five rods broad, and the third 4 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> with
a vein 1¼ rods broad, the mines of Blaunchlond in
Northumberland, Fletchers in Alston, Keswick in
Cumberland, and also the copper mine near Richmond,
were granted for fifteen years to the Duke of
Gloucester, the Earl of Northumberland, William
Goderswyk, and John Marchall.<a name="Anchor-199" id="Anchor-199"></a><a href="#Footnote-199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a> The two noblemen
were presumably sleeping partners, and appear
to have abandoned the arrangement, as soon afterwards,
in 1478, William Goderswyk, Henry Van
Orel, Arnold van Anne, and Albert Millyng of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>Cologne, and Dederic van Riswyk of England,
received a grant for ten years of all mines of gold,
silver, copper, and lead in Northumberland, Cumberland,
and Westmoreland, paying one-fifteenth of the
profits.<a name="Anchor-200" id="Anchor-200"></a><a href="#Footnote-200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a></p>

<p>Although gold is mentioned in this last entry and
in a number of other grants of mines in the fifteenth
century, and though Galias de Lune and his partners
were licensed in 1462 to dig ores containing gold
in Gloucestershire and Somerset,<a name="Anchor-201" id="Anchor-201"></a><a href="#Footnote-201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a> gold does not
appear to have been worked in paying quantities
in England. In 1325 John de Wylwringword was
sent down to the mines of Devon and Cornwall
to seek for gold: he obtained from the Devon mines
22 <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr>, of which he refined 3 <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr> at Exeter; this
yielded 2½ <abbr title="pennyweight">dwt.</abbr> of pure gold.<a name="Anchor-202" id="Anchor-202"></a><a href="#Footnote-202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a> The remainder was
sent up to the Exchequer and eventually refined at
York; but this is almost the only note we have of
gold being found, though no doubt small quantities
were found from time to time in the Cornish stream
tinworks.</p>

<p>In 1545 one <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Clere declared that certain gold
called 'gold hoppes and gold oore' in every stream
tinwork in Devon and Cornwall was by ignorance of
the tinners molten with the tin, and so conveyed
abroad; certain persons were appointed to test his
statement.<a name="Anchor-203" id="Anchor-203"></a><a href="#Footnote-203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV</abbr><br />

<small>MINING—TIN</small></h2>


<p>Tin mining claims an antiquity unsurpassed by any
other industry in this country, but with what degree
of justice may well be doubted. The claim of the
western promontory of Britain, later known as
Cornwall and Devon, to be the Cassiterides or Tin
Islands whence the Phœnicians obtained their stores
of that metal at least five hundred years before the
Christian era rests upon rather shadowy grounds.<a name="Anchor-204" id="Anchor-204"></a><a href="#Footnote-204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a>
Diodorus Siculus, who wrote about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 30, is the
first writer definitely to connect Britain with the
tin trade, and his statements appear to be based
rather upon a doubtful understanding of earlier
topographers than upon actual knowledge. According
to him the tin was produced in the promontory
of 'Bolerium' and brought to the island of 'Ictis,'
whence it was transported to Gaul. If 'Bolerium'
is Cornwall, then there is no reason to doubt that
'Ictis' is 'Insula Vectis,' or the Isle of Wight, which
was at that date still connected to the mainland by
a narrow ridge of rock, covered at highwater, but dry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>at low water, as 'Ictis' is said to have been.<a name="Anchor-205" id="Anchor-205"></a><a href="#Footnote-205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> It is
certainly strange, if an ancient and well-established
trade in tin really existed in Britain when the
Romans came over, that that race, with its keen
eye for metallic wealth, should have made no use of
the tin mines of Cornwall. Yet there is no reference
to these mines in the literature of the period of the
Roman occupation, nor are there traces of anything
approaching an occupation of Cornwall by the
Romans, who appear to have ignored this corner
of Britain completely. After the departure of the
Romans, and before the Saxons conquered this
district, which did not happen till the middle of
the tenth century, there is some evidence of tin
being worked here, as Cornish tin is said to have
been carried over to France in the seventh century,
and in a life of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of Alexandria, who died in
616, there is a story of an Alexandrian galley coming
to Britain for tin.<a name="Anchor-206" id="Anchor-206"></a><a href="#Footnote-206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a> That the Saxons worked the tin
seems probable from the discovery of Saxon remains
in the <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Austell tin grounds and elsewhere,<a name="Anchor-207" id="Anchor-207"></a><a href="#Footnote-207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> but
the industry can hardly have been of any great
importance at the time of the Norman Conquest, as
there is no reference to it in the Domesday Survey.</p>

<p>While the history of tin mining in Britain prior to
the middle of the twelfth century is problematical,
there is from that time onwards an immense mass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>of material bearing upon the subject. This material
has been patiently examined by Mr. George Randall
Lewis, and summarised in his work on <cite>The Stannaries</cite>,<a name="Anchor-208" id="Anchor-208"></a><a href="#Footnote-208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a>
a book so full and complete that I have
saved myself much labour by basing this chapter
almost entirely upon it.</p>

<p>There are, as might be expected, many analogies
between the mining of tin and the mining of lead.
The processes were very similar, and the laws
governing the workers had much in common, but it
is in the case of the Stannaries that we find the full
development of the 'free miner,' so far as England
is concerned. Certain initial differences in the
methods employed are observable owing to the form
in which tin is obtained. Tin, like other metals,
exists in veins or lodes embedded in the rock at
various depths; where these veins outcrop on the
banks of a stream they are broken up by the action
of the water and climatic variations, the resultant
pile of stanniferous boulders being known as 'shode';
the waters of the stream constantly wear away
small pieces of the tin ore and carry it downwards
until, owing to its heavy specific gravity, the tin
sinks, forming a deposit in the bed of the stream
which may sometimes be as much as twenty feet
thick. It was this third class of alluvial tin which
was alone worked in prehistoric and early medieval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>days. This might safely be assumed, but rather remarkable
confirmation is obtained from an account
of tin worked for Edmund of Cornwall in 1297.
From this it appears that twenty-eight and a half
'foot-fates' of ore produced a thousand-weight
(1200 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>) of 'white tin,' the proportion corresponding
pretty closely with those—three 'foot-fates'
of ore to yield 105 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of metal—given in the
sixteenth century by Thomas Beare for alluvial
or 'stream' tin, which was far richer than mine
tin.<a name="Anchor-209" id="Anchor-209"></a><a href="#Footnote-209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a> It cannot have been very long before the
miners realised that the stream tin was carried down
by the water, and started to search for its source.
The 'shode,' or boulder tin, must therefore have
been worked almost as early as the alluvial deposits,
and the final stage was the working of the 'lode.'
In this lode mining the first workings were no doubt
shallow trenches and confined to places where the
ore lay close to the surface; a somewhat greater
depth was obtained by 'shamelling,' the trench
being carried down in stages, a 'shamell' or platform
being left at each stage at the height to which
the miner could throw his ore; finally came the
deep shaft with galleries. But here, as in all mining,
the question of drainage came in. Where the workings
were quite shallow the water could be baled
out with wooden bowls, or a 'level,' or deep ditch,
could be dug. For greater depths the adit, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>drainage gallery (see above, p. 50), was available,
and although Mr. Lewis<a name="Anchor-210" id="Anchor-210"></a><a href="#Footnote-210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a> cannot find any instance of
the use of the adit in tin mining before the seventeenth
century, it does not seem reasonable to doubt
that it was in use much earlier. Exactly when
pumps and other draining machines were introduced
into the tin mines is not clear, but probably they
were little used during our medieval period, when
few of the mines were of any great depth.<a name="Anchor-211" id="Anchor-211"></a><a href="#Footnote-211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a></p>

<p>The primitive miner, when he had got his ore with
the aid of his simple tools, a wooden shovel and a
pick, also in earliest times of wood, but later of iron,
constructed a rough hearth of stones on which he
kindled a fire. When it was burning strongly he cast
in his ore and afterwards collected the molten tin from
the ashes. The next stage was to construct a regular
furnace, exactly similar in type to the boles or furnaces
used for lead-melting (see above, p. 51). These
furnaces were enclosed in a building, the 'blowing-house,'
in early times a rough thatched shanty,
which was burnt from time to time to obtain the
metallic dust which had lodged in the thatch, but
afterwards more substantial. The cost of a 'melting
howse' (80 feet by 20 feet) built at Larian in Cornwall
by Burcord Crangs, a German, in the time of Queen
Mary, was about £300, composed as follows:<a name="Anchor-212" id="Anchor-212"></a><a href="#Footnote-212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a>—</p>

<p>The lumps of ore were first broken up with
hammers or in a mill; the powdered ore was then
washed to free it as far as possible from earthy impurities.
Sometimes this was done with a 'vanne,'
or shovel, the heavy ore remaining at the point of
the shovel and the lighter impurities being washed
away. An elaborate process was also used, in which
the water containing the powdered ore was allowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>to run over pieces of turf, the metallic portion
sinking and becoming entangled in the fibres. The
usual method, however, was by means of troughs
or 'buddles.' This washing was not only a necessary
preliminary to the smelting, but had an economic
importance, as it was at the wash that the ore was
divided when a claim was worked by partners, and
the tribute or share due to the lord of the soil was
apportioned; it was also, towards the end of the
medieval period, the only place where the ore might
be bought by dealers.<a name="Anchor-215" id="Anchor-215"></a><a href="#Footnote-215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a> To prevent fraud it was
therefore enacted that due notice should be given
of washes, and no secret buddles should be used.</p>

<p>When we first get any details of tin-working, in
1198, it was usual for the tin to be smelted twice,
the first being a rough process performed near the
tinfield, but the second, or refining, being only
permitted at special places and in the presence of
the officers of the stannaries. The tin from the
first smelting had to be stamped by the royal officers
within two weeks of smelting, a toll being paid to the
king at the same time of 2s. 6d. per thousand-weight
in Devon, and of 5s. in Cornwall. Moreover, by the
regulations of 1198, within thirteen weeks the tin
had to be resmelted and again stamped, this time
paying a tax of one mark.<a name="Anchor-216" id="Anchor-216"></a><a href="#Footnote-216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a> The double smelting
possibly ceased before the end of the thirteenth
century. In any case the fiscal arrangement was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>altered, and in 1302, not long after the stannaries
had reverted to the Crown, after being in the hands
of the Earls of Cornwall from 1231 to 1300, we find
the stampage dues consolidated into a single coinage
duty. Under this system of coinage all the tin
smelted had to be sent to certain specified towns,
those for Cornwall being Bodmin, Liskeard, Lostwithiel,
Helston, and Truro; and for Devon, Chagford,
Tavistock, Plympton, and Ashburton. Here
the tin remained until the two yearly visits of the
coinage officials, at Michaelmas and Midsummer,
when each block, weighing roughly 200 to 300 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>,
was assayed, weighed, and taxed: it was then
stamped and might be sold. To prevent fraud an
elaborate system of marking was gradually introduced
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
and the use of private marks by the owners
of the blowing-houses was probably of much earlier
origin. The use of these marks was designed not
only to protect the merchant, but also to act as a
check on smuggling, of which an immense amount
undoubtedly went on.<a name="Anchor-217" id="Anchor-217"></a><a href="#Footnote-217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a></p>

<p>One result of the coinage system, by which tin
might not be sold until stamped, and could only be
stamped twice a year, was that the smaller tin-workers
inevitably fell into the hands of the capitalists.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>The small independent tinner, with no reserve
of capital to draw upon, had almost always to pledge
his tin in advance to the adventurers and tin-dealers,
and as a result he was often worse off with his theoretical
independence than he would have been as a
recognised wage-labourer. The wage work system
must have been introduced into the stannaries at
quite an early period. Even in 1237 there are
references to servants who worked the mines for the
tinners.<a name="Anchor-218" id="Anchor-218"></a><a href="#Footnote-218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a> In 1342 certain of the wealthier Cornish
tinners endeavoured to force their poorer brethren to
work for them at a penny a day, when they had been
working tin worth 20d. or more daily, and it is said
that Abraham the tinner in 1357 was actually employing
three hundred persons on his works. Side by
side with these hired workmen were the independent
tinners, working either separately or, more usually
in partnerships; but from the small amounts which
many of these tinners presented for coinage, Mr.
Lewis has concluded that they may have been only
partly dependent upon their mining.<a name="Anchor-219" id="Anchor-219"></a><a href="#Footnote-219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a> There is,
however, the complication that the small amounts
presented may in part have been due to their
having sold their ore to the larger dealers, but it
is clear that some of the tinners did also carry on
farming.</p>

<p>While the economic position of the smaller tinners
must often have been little, if at all, superior to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>of ordinary labourers, their political position was
remarkable. They constituted a state within a
state; the free miner 'paid taxes not as an Englishman,
but as a miner. His law was not the law of the
realm, but that of his mine. He obeyed the king
only when his orders were communicated through
the warden of the mines, and even then so long only
as he respected the mining law. His courts were the
mine courts, his parliament the mine parliament.'<a name="Anchor-220" id="Anchor-220"></a><a href="#Footnote-220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a>
The tinner was a free man and could not be subjected
to the system of villeinage. He had the right
of prospecting anywhere within the two counties,
except in churchyards, highways, and gardens, and
might 'bound' or stake out a claim by the simple
process of cutting shallow holes and making piles of
turf at the four corners of his claim, and such claim
would be his absolute property provided that he
worked it (the exact amount of work necessary to
retain a claim varied in different places and at
different periods). For his claim he paid to the lord
of the land, whether it were the king or a private
lord, a certain tribute of ore, usually the tenth or the
fifteenth portion. He had, moreover, the right to
divert streams, either to obtain water for washing
his ore, or to enable him to dig in the bed of the
stream, and the important privilege of compelling
landowners to sell him fuel for his furnace. Further,
he had his own courts, and was under the sole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>jurisdiction of the warden-officers of the stannaries.
Each stannary, of which there were five in Cornwall
and four in Devon, had its own court, presided over
by a steward, and no tinner might plead or be
impleaded outside his court, from which the appeal
lay to the warden, or in practice to the vice-warden.
How and when these privileges were obtained must
remain a matter for speculation, but they can be
traced when William de Wrotham was appointed
warden in 1198, and were definitely confirmed to
the tinners by King John in 1201. By development,
apparently, from the two yearly great courts of the
stannaries, arose the 'stannary parliaments.' The
parliament for Cornwall consisted of twenty-four
members, six being nominated by the mayor and
council of each of the four towns of Lostwithiel,
Launceston, Truro, and Helston; that of Devon
contained ninety-six members, twenty-four from
each of the stannaries. Those parliaments were
summoned, through the lord warden, by the Duke
of Cornwall, in whom the supreme control of the
stannaries was vested from 1338 onwards, and had
power not only to legislate for the stannaries, but
to veto any national legislation which infringed their
privileges. When the parliaments originated is not
known, but they were certainly established before
the beginning of the sixteenth century, prior to
which date all records of their proceedings are
lost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>With all these privileges, to which may be added
exemption from ordinary taxation and military
service, though the tinners were liable to be taxed
separately and enrolled for service under their own
officers, it was natural that the exact definition of a
tinner should have given rise to much dispute. On
the one hand, it was argued that these exemptions
and privileges applied only to working tinners
actually employed in getting ore; on the other, the
tin dealers, blowers, and owners of blowing-houses
claimed to be included. Eventually the larger
definition was accepted, and, indeed, it was almost
entirely from the capitalist section of the industry
that the parliaments were elected, from the sixteenth
century, if not earlier.</p>

<p>It is rather remarkable that when the stannaries
first come into evidence, in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>,
the chief centre of production appears to have been
Devon rather than Cornwall.<a name="Anchor-221" id="Anchor-221"></a><a href="#Footnote-221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a> So far as can be
estimated the output during this reign rose gradually
from about 70 tons in 1156 to about 350 in 1171.
Richard <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr>, with his constant need of money, reorganised
the stannaries in 1198, and at the beginning
of John's reign the output was between 400 and 450
tons. The issue of the charter to the stannaries
in 1201 does not seem to have had any immediate
effect on the industry, but about ten years later
there was increased activity, the output rising in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>1214 to 600 tons.<a name="Anchor-222" id="Anchor-222"></a><a href="#Footnote-222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a> During the early years of
Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> the tin revenues were farmed out, and no
details are available either for these years, or from
the period 1225-1300, during which time the stannaries
were in the hands of the Earls of Cornwall.
Two things only are clear, that the total output
had fallen off, and that Cornwall had now far outstripped
Devon. The grant of a charter confirming
the privileges of the stannaries in 1305 seems to
have marked the beginning of a more prosperous
era, and by 1337 the output had reached 700 tons.
The Black Death, however, in 1350 put an end to
this prosperity, and with the exception of a boom
during the reign of Henry <abbr title="the fourth"><span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span></abbr> tinning did not recover
until just at the end of our medieval period. Even
at its worst, however, the industry was a source of
considerable revenue, the coinage duties<a name="Anchor-223" id="Anchor-223"></a><a href="#Footnote-223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a> never
falling below £1000, and amounting in 1337 and
1400 to over £3000, in addition to which there were
other smaller payments and perquisites.<a name="Anchor-224" id="Anchor-224"></a><a href="#Footnote-224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a> The royal
privileges of pre-emption was also of value to needy
kings who frequently availed themselves of it to
grant this pre-emption, or virtual monopoly, to
wealthy foreign merchants and other money-lenders
in return for substantial loans.</p>

<p>Before leaving the subject of the tin mines of
Cornwall and Devon, it is perhaps worth while
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>noting that there is virtually no documentary
evidence of the working of the copper deposits of
Cornwall prior to the late sixteenth century, and it
would seem that most of the copper used in medieval
England must have been imported.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr><br />

<small>QUARRYING—STONE, MARBLE, ALABASTER, CHALK</small></h2>


<p>Stone-quarrying is an industry to which the
references in medieval records are more numerous
than enlightening. It would be easy to fill pages
with a list of casual references to the working of
quarries in all parts of England, and after struggling
through the list the reader would know that stone
was dug in quite a lot of places at different times,
which he might have assumed without the documentary
evidence. It is natural that when a
castle, an abbey, a church, or other stone building
is to be erected the stone, whose cost lies mainly in
transport, should be obtained from the nearest
possible source. Founders of monasteries frequently
made grants either of existing quarries or of the
right to dig stone for the monastic buildings, and the
discovery of a bed of suitable stone close to the site
selected for the Conqueror's votive abbey of Battle
was so opportune as to be deemed a miracle.<a name="Anchor-225" id="Anchor-225"></a><a href="#Footnote-225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a> When
a monastery was founded in a district where stone
could not be found, it was almost essential that its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>supplies should be drawn if possible from some place
from which the stone could be carried by water, and
it was no doubt the position of Barnack between the
Welland and the Nene that made its quarries so
important to the monks of the Fenland.<a name="Anchor-226" id="Anchor-226"></a><a href="#Footnote-226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a> The
abbeys of Peterborough, Ramsey, Crowland, Bury
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmund and Sawtry all held quarries in Barnack
and quarrelled amongst themselves over their
respective rights. The monks of Sawtry, for instance,
had made a canal for carrying stone to their
abbey by way of Wittlesea Mere by permission
of the abbey of Ramsey, a permission which they
seem to have abused, as in 1192 orders were given
to block all their lodes except the main one leading
to Sawtry, and they had to promise to put up no
buildings except one rest house for the men on their
stone barges.<a name="Anchor-227" id="Anchor-227"></a><a href="#Footnote-227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a></p>

<p>For York Minster<a name="Anchor-228" id="Anchor-228"></a><a href="#Footnote-228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a> stone was brought from the
quarries of Thevesdale, Huddleston, and Tadcaster
down the Wharfe, and from Stapleton down the
Aire into the Ouse, and so up to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Leonard's wharf,
whence it was carried on sleds to the mason's yard.
Westminster and London were mainly supplied from
Surrey, from the Reigate and Chaldon quarries, and
Kent, from the Maidstone district. The tough
'Kentish rag,' which was used by the Romans for
the walls of London, was much in demand for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>rougher masonry,<a name="Anchor-229" id="Anchor-229"></a><a href="#Footnote-229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a> and in a contract for building a
wharf by the Tower in 1389, it was stipulated that
the core of the walls should be of 'raggs,' and the
facing of 'assheler de Kent.'<a name="Anchor-230" id="Anchor-230"></a><a href="#Footnote-230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a> The Reigate stone,
on the other hand, was of superior quality and more
suited for fine work, and we find it constantly used
for images, carved niches, and window tracery.<a name="Anchor-231" id="Anchor-231"></a><a href="#Footnote-231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a></p>

<p>The most accessible stone not always being the
most suitable for the varying requirements of architecture,
it was necessary to find other stone possessing
the desired qualities, and certain quarries at an
early date acquired renown. Setting aside the
famous Norman quarries of Caen, whose stone appears
in greater or less quantities in hundreds of buildings
and of records, there are a number of English quarries
of more than local repute in medieval times. Such
were the quarries of Beer in Devonshire, from whose
labyrinthine galleries stone was carried to Rochester
in 1367,<a name="Anchor-232" id="Anchor-232"></a><a href="#Footnote-232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a> to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's Westminster in 1362,<a name="Anchor-233" id="Anchor-233"></a><a href="#Footnote-233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a> and
elsewhere. The fine limestone, later known as Bath
Stone, was quarried to a large extent at Haslebury
in Box in Wiltshire, from which place it was sent
in 1221 to the royal palace at Winchester for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>columns of the hall and for chimney hoods,<a name="Anchor-234" id="Anchor-234"></a><a href="#Footnote-234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a> Richard
Sired receiving 23s. 4d. for cutting 105 blocks of
stone in the quarry of Hesalburi.<a name="Anchor-235" id="Anchor-235"></a><a href="#Footnote-235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235.">[235]</a> For these same
works at Winchester much stone was brought from
the Hampshire quarry of Selebourne, and from the
better known quarries of the Isle of Wight, while a
stone-cutter was sent to procure material from the
quarry of Corfe. This latter was no doubt the same
as the 'hard stone of Corfe,' bought for Westminster
in 1278.<a name="Anchor-236" id="Anchor-236"></a><a href="#Footnote-236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a> With Corfe and Purbeck is associated
Portland stone, which attained its greatest fame in

already appreciated in the fourteenth century, when
it was used in Exeter Cathedral and at Westminster.<a name="Anchor-237" id="Anchor-237"></a><a href="#Footnote-237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237.">[237]</a>
Further east Sussex possessed a number of quarries
of local importance,<a name="Anchor-238" id="Anchor-238"></a><a href="#Footnote-238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238.">[238]</a> and the quarry of green sandstone
at Eastbourne, from which the great Roman
walls of Pevensey and the medieval castle within
them were alike built, probably provided the '28
stones of Burne, worked for windows of the vault
under the chapel' at Shene in 1441.<a name="Anchor-239" id="Anchor-239"></a><a href="#Footnote-239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239.">[239]</a> Another Sussex
quarry, that of Fairlight, near Hastings, supplied
large quantities of stone for Rochester Castle in
1366 and 1367.<a name="Anchor-240" id="Anchor-240"></a><a href="#Footnote-240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240.">[240]</a> The list of stone brought in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>latter year at Rochester is of interest as showing
the various sources from which it was derived.<a name="Anchor-241" id="Anchor-241"></a><a href="#Footnote-241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a>
There were bought 55 tons of Beer freestone at
prices varying from 9s. to 10s. the ton,<a name="Anchor-242" id="Anchor-242"></a><a href="#Footnote-242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 242.">[242]</a> 62 tons of
Caen stone at 9s., 45 tons of Stapleton freestone<a name="Anchor-243" id="Anchor-243"></a><a href="#Footnote-243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a>
at 8s., 44 tons of Reigate stone at 6s., 195 tons of
freestone from Fairlight at 3s. 4d., 1850 tons of
rag from Maidstone at 40s. the hundred tons, and
a large quantity<a name="Anchor-244" id="Anchor-244"></a><a href="#Footnote-244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a> of worked stone from Boughton
Mounchelsea.</p>

<p>The Kentish quarries seem to have been especially
favoured for the manufacture of the stone balls
flung by the royal artillery, in early days by mangonels,
balistae, and other forms of catapults, and in
later days by guns. Thus in 1342 the sheriff of Kent
accounted for £13, 10s. spent on 300 stones dug in
the quarry of Folkestone and drawn out of the sea
in various places, and afterwards cut and hewn into
round balls for the king's machines; one hundred
weighing 600 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> each, and the same number 500 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>
and 400 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> respectively; and a further £7, 10s. for
another 300 stone balls of various weights.<a name="Anchor-245" id="Anchor-245"></a><a href="#Footnote-245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245.">[245]</a> It is
true that some years earlier, in 1333, similar balls
had been obtained in Yorkshire, the sheriff buying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>19 damlades<a name="Anchor-246" id="Anchor-246"></a><a href="#Footnote-246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 246.">[246]</a> and 3 tons of stone in the quarry of
Tadcaster, and setting 37 masons to work, the result
being 606 stone balls weighing 9 damlades,<a name="Anchor-247" id="Anchor-247"></a><a href="#Footnote-247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 247.">[247]</a> but
casual references point to Kent as the great centre
of manufacture. In 1418 as many as 7000 such
balls were ordered to be made at Maidstone and
elsewhere, and the Maidstone quarries were still
turning out stone shot for bombards during the
early years of Henry <abbr title="the eighth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span></abbr><a name="Anchor-248" id="Anchor-248"></a><a href="#Footnote-248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 248.">[248]</a></p>

<p>So far we have been dealing with what may be
called block stone, but there were also in many
parts of the country stones that from the ease with
which they could be split into thin slabs were suitable
for roofing purposes. How early, and to what
extent the true slates of Cornwall and Devon were
worked it is difficult to say, but in 1296, when certain
buildings were put up for the miners at Martinestowe
23,000 'sclattes' were quarried at Birlond, and
another 10,000 at 'Hassal.'<a name="Anchor-249" id="Anchor-249"></a><a href="#Footnote-249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 249.">[249]</a> For the roofing of
buildings at Restormel in Cornwall in 1343 slates
were employed, 19,500 being bought 'between
Golant and Fowey,' at 11d. the thousand, and 85,500
dug in the quarry of Bodmatgan at a cost of 6d.
the thousand.<a name="Anchor-250" id="Anchor-250"></a><a href="#Footnote-250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 250.">[250]</a> So also in 1385, at Lostwithiel, it
is probable that the 'tiles,' of which 25,400 were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>bought 'in the quarry' at 3s. 4d. the thousand were
true slates.<a name="Anchor-251" id="Anchor-251"></a><a href="#Footnote-251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 251.">[251]</a> But besides the real slates, which in
their modern uniformity of perfection render so
many towns hideous, there were many quarries of
stone slates, of which the most famous were at
Collyweston in Northants.<a name="Anchor-252" id="Anchor-252"></a><a href="#Footnote-252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 252.">[252]</a> The Collyweston stone
after being exposed to the influence of frost could
easily be split into thin slabs,<a name="Anchor-253" id="Anchor-253"></a><a href="#Footnote-253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 253.">[253]</a> and seem to have
been used for roofing purposes as early as the times of
the Romans. During the medieval period there are
numerous references to these Collyweston slates,
and about the end of the fourteenth century they
seem to have fetched from 6s. to 8s. the thousand.<a name="Anchor-254" id="Anchor-254"></a><a href="#Footnote-254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a>
Other similar quarries of more than local fame
were situated round Horsham in Sussex,<a name="Anchor-255" id="Anchor-255"></a><a href="#Footnote-255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a> and Horsham
slates continued in demand from early days
until the diminished solidity of house construction
made a less weighty, and incidentally less picturesque,
material requisite for roofing.</p>

<p>The work of quarrying stone counted as unskilled
labour, and the rate of pay of quarriers is almost
always that of the ordinary labourer. At Martinstow
in 1296, men 'breaking stone in the quarry'
received 1½d. to 2d. a day, and women, always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>the cheapest form of labour, 1d. a day for carrying
the stones from the quarry.<a name="Anchor-256" id="Anchor-256"></a><a href="#Footnote-256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a> The Windsor accounts
for 1368 show quarriers at Bisham (Bustesham)
receiving 3½d. a day, and one, no doubt the foreman,
4d., while 65,000 blocks of stone were cut at 'Colingle'
at 10s. the thousand, and 3500 at Stoneden at 20s.<a name="Anchor-257" id="Anchor-257"></a><a href="#Footnote-257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a>
Those employed upon shaping the rough blocks
were naturally paid at a higher rate, and in 1333,
while the quarriers at Tadcaster were paid 1s. 4d.
a week, the masons employed there in making stone
balls earned 2s. 6d., and their foremen 3s. a week.<a name="Anchor-258" id="Anchor-258"></a><a href="#Footnote-258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a>
Often, however, the payment was by piece work,
and in the case of the stone wrought at Boughton
Monchelsea in 1366 for Rochester Castle, we have a
list of the rates of payment: 'rough ashlar' worked
at 10s. the hundred, 'parpainassheler'—for
mullions—cut to pattern 18s. the hundred, newel
pieces 12d. each, jambs 3d. the foot, 'scu' or
bevelled stones 2d. the foot, voussoirs (<i>vausur</i>) 5d.
the foot, and so on.<a name="Anchor-259" id="Anchor-259"></a><a href="#Footnote-259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a> The tools used were of a simple
nature; the inventory of tools at Stapleton quarry
in 1400<a name="Anchor-260" id="Anchor-260"></a><a href="#Footnote-260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a> shows a number of iron wedges, iron rods,
'gavelokes' or crowbars, iron hammers, 'pulyng
axes,'<a name="Anchor-261" id="Anchor-261"></a><a href="#Footnote-261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a> 'brocheaxes' and shovels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>So far we have been dealing with stone as a building
material, but there were two varieties of stone
worked in England in medieval times whose value
was artistic rather than utilitarian. These were
marble and alabaster. <span class="smcap">Purbeck Marble</span>,<a name="Anchor-262" id="Anchor-262"></a><a href="#Footnote-262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a> a dark
shell conglomerate capable of receiving a very high
polish, came into fashion towards the end of the
twelfth century, and continued in great demand for
some two hundred years. Not only was it used in
1205 at Chichester Cathedral, but it would seem that
some thirty years earlier it was sent to Dublin and
to Durham. All the evidence goes to show that the
marble was not only quarried at Purbeck, but worked
into columns and carved upon the spot, and it is
probable that most, if not all, of the scores of marble
effigies which still remain in churches, such as the
figures of knights in the Temple Church and the
tomb of King John at Worcester, were carved by
members of the Purbeck school<a name="Anchor-263" id="Anchor-263"></a><a href="#Footnote-263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a> and usually at the
quarries, though in some cases it would seem that
the carver was called upon to do his work at the
place where it was to be used, and under the eye of
his patron. But however much we may admire
the execution of these Purbeck effigies, we must not
hastily assume that they bear any particular resemblance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>to the persons whom they commemorate; for
although the Purbeck carvers were no doubt capable
of executing portrait sculpture, a large proportion
of their work was undoubtedly conventional. Thus
in 1253 we find Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> ordering the sheriff of
Dorset to cause 'an image of a queen' to be cut in
marble and carried to the nunnery of Tarrant
Keynston, there to be placed over the tomb of his
sister, the late Queen of Scots.<a name="Anchor-264" id="Anchor-264"></a><a href="#Footnote-264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a></p>

<p>Corfe was the great centre of the Purbeck marble
industry. William of Corfe who executed the tomb
of 'Henry the King's son,' at Westminster in 1273,<a name="Anchor-265" id="Anchor-265"></a><a href="#Footnote-265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a>
was probably William le Blund, brother of Robert
le Blund, also called Robert of Corfe, who supplied
marble for the Eleanor crosses at Waltham, Northampton,
and Lincoln; and one Adam of Corfe settled
in London early in the fourteenth century, and died
there in 1331. This Adam 'the marbler' seems to
have carried out several large contracts, including
the paving of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Paul's, and in 1324 supplied great
quantities of marble for the columns of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's,
Westminster, at 6d. the foot.<a name="Anchor-266" id="Anchor-266"></a><a href="#Footnote-266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a> The same price was
paid in 1333 for similar columns bought from Richard
Canon,<a name="Anchor-267" id="Anchor-267"></a><a href="#Footnote-267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267.">[267]</a> one of a family which for a century and a
half played a prominent part as carvers and marble
merchants, particularly in connection with Exeter
Cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>By the sixteenth century, and probably for some
time earlier, the 'Marblers and Stone Cutters of
Purbeck' had formed themselves into a company.
By their rules the industry was restricted to freemen
of the company, and regulations were laid down
as to the number of apprentices that might be
employed. These apprentices, in turn, could become
freemen at the end of seven years upon payment
to the court held at Corfe Castle on Shrove
Tuesday of 6s. 8d. and the render of a penny loaf
and two pots of beer. The wives of freemen were
also allowed to join the company on payment of 1s.,
and in that case might carry on the trade, with the
assistance of an apprentice, after their husband's
death. At the time, however, that this company
was formed, it is probable that the greater part of
their business was concerned with building stone,
as the marble had gone out of fashion and been
largely superseded by alabaster in the fifteenth
century for sepulchral monuments.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alabaster</span> appears to have been dug in the neighbourhood
of Tutbury in very early times, some of
the Norman mouldings of the west door of Tutbury
church being carved in this material.<a name="Anchor-268" id="Anchor-268"></a><a href="#Footnote-268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a> It is in the
same neighbourhood, at Hanbury, that the earliest
known sepulchral image in alabaster is to be found:
this dates from the early years of the fourteenth
century, but it was not until the middle of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>century that the vogue of alabaster began. From
1360 onwards there exists a magnificent series of
alabaster monuments which bear striking testimony
to the skill of the medieval English carvers,<a name="Anchor-269" id="Anchor-269"></a><a href="#Footnote-269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a> and it
is clear from records and the evidence of such fragments
as have survived the triple iconoclasm of
Reformers, Puritans, and Churchwardens that these
monuments found worthy companions in the statues
and carved reredoses scattered throughout the
churches of England.<a name="Anchor-270" id="Anchor-270"></a><a href="#Footnote-270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a> One of the finest of these
reredoses must have been the 'table of alabaster'
bought in 1367 for the high altar of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George's,
Windsor. For this the enormous sum of £200 (more
than £3000 of modern money) was paid to Peter
Mason of Nottingham, while some idea of its size
may be gathered from the fact that it took ten carts,
each with eight horses, to bring it from Nottingham
to Windsor, the journey occupying seventeen days.<a name="Anchor-271" id="Anchor-271"></a><a href="#Footnote-271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a></p>

<p>All the evidence points to Nottingham having
been the great centre of the industry, the material
being brought from the Derbyshire quarries of
Chellaston. The stone and the workmanship alike
found favour outside this country, and in 1414, when
the abbot of Fécamp required alabaster he sent his
mason, Alexander de Berneval, to England to procure
it; and it was from Thomas Prentis of Chellaston
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>that the stone was bought.<a name="Anchor-272" id="Anchor-272"></a><a href="#Footnote-272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a> The alabaster tomb of
John, Duke of Bretagne, which was erected in Nantes
Cathedral in 1408, was made in England by Thomas
Colyn, Thomas Holewell, and Thomas Poppehowe,<a name="Anchor-273" id="Anchor-273"></a><a href="#Footnote-273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a>
but it is not certain that they belonged to Nottingham.
Various customs accounts<a name="Anchor-274" id="Anchor-274"></a><a href="#Footnote-274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a> show that carved
alabaster figures were often exported to the Continent,
and Mr. Hope has shown that a number of
carvings still to be seen in the churches of France,
and even of Iceland,<a name="Anchor-275" id="Anchor-275"></a><a href="#Footnote-275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a> have the green background,
with circular groups of red and white spots, peculiar
to the Nottingham school.<a name="Anchor-276" id="Anchor-276"></a><a href="#Footnote-276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Prentis, who is mentioned above, is found
in 1419 in company with Robert Sutton<a name="Anchor-277" id="Anchor-277"></a><a href="#Footnote-277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a> covenanting
to carve, paint, and gild the elaborate and
beautiful tomb of Ralph Green and his wife, which
may still be seen in Lowick Church, Northants, for
a sum of £40. An examination of this tomb makes
it almost certain that the glorious monuments of
the Earl and Countess of Arundel at Arundel,
Henry <abbr title="the fourth"><span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span></abbr> and Queen Joan at Canterbury, and the
Earl of Westmoreland and his two wives at Staindrop,
were all from the same workshop. During
the last twenty years of the fifteenth and the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>thirty years of the sixteenth century, we have the
names of a number of 'alablastermen' and 'image-makers'
in Nottingham,<a name="Anchor-278" id="Anchor-278"></a><a href="#Footnote-278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a> Nicholas Hill in particular
being prominent as a manufacturer of the popular
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the Baptist heads,<a name="Anchor-279" id="Anchor-279"></a><a href="#Footnote-279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a> and during the same
period we find a number of 'alblasterers' at York.<a name="Anchor-280" id="Anchor-280"></a><a href="#Footnote-280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a>
At Burton-on-Trent, also, where Leland in the
sixteenth century mentions 'many marbellers
working in alabaster,' the trade was evidently established
in 1481, when Robert Bocher and Gilbert
Twist were working for a number of religious houses;
and it still flourished there in 1581 and 1585, when
Richard and Gabriel Royley undertook contracts
for elaborate tombs of alabaster,<a name="Anchor-281" id="Anchor-281"></a><a href="#Footnote-281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a> but for all practical
purposes the English school of alabaster carvers
ceased to exist when the Reformation put an end to
the demand for images and carven tables.</p>

<p>The alabaster, or gypsum, when not suitable for
carving, was still valuable for conversion into plaster
by burning, the finer varieties yielding the so-called
Plaster of Paris and the coarser the ordinary builders'
plaster. References to the actual burning of plaster
seem practically non-existent, but it is noteworthy
that one of the places from which Plaster of Paris
was obtained for the works at York Minster was
Buttercrambe,<a name="Anchor-282" id="Anchor-282"></a><a href="#Footnote-282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a> where there is a large deposit of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>gypsum which probably furnished the York alabasterers
with their material. In the same way
<span class="smcap">Chalk</span>, though to some extent used for masonry,
was most in demand for conversion into lime.
When building operations of any importance were
undertaken, it was usual to build a limekiln on the
spot for the burning of the lime required for mortar.
In earlier times the kiln seems to have taken the form
of a pit, 'lymeputt' or, in Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">puteus</i>, being the
term usually employed, but in 1400 we find a regular
kiln (<i>torale</i>) built, 3300 bricks and 33 loads of clay
being purchased for the purpose.<a name="Anchor-283" id="Anchor-283"></a><a href="#Footnote-283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a> Where lime was
burnt commercially, that is to say for sale and not
merely for use on the spot, the kilns would naturally
be larger and more permanent, and a sixteenth-century
account of the erection of eight such kilns<a name="Anchor-284" id="Anchor-284"></a><a href="#Footnote-284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a>
at a place unnamed—probably Calais—shows that
each kiln was 20 feet high, with walls 10 feet thick,
and an average internal breadth of 10 feet, and cost
over £450.</p>

<p>When wood was plentiful it was naturally employed
for burning the lime, and a presentment made
in 1255 with regard to the forest of Wellington
mentions that the king's two limekilns (<i>rees calcis</i>)
had devoured 500 oaks between them.<a name="Anchor-285" id="Anchor-285"></a><a href="#Footnote-285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a> But it was
soon found that pit coal was the best fuel for the
purpose, and it was constantly used from the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>of the thirteenth century onwards, as much as
1166 quarters of sea coal being bought in 1278 for
the kilns (<i>chauffornia</i>) in connection with the work
at the Tower.<a name="Anchor-286" id="Anchor-286"></a><a href="#Footnote-286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> For the most part, chalk and lime
required for work at London or Westminster was
brought from Greenwich. Kent has indeed always
been one of the great centres of the trade, both home
and foreign, and in 1527,<a name="Anchor-287" id="Anchor-287"></a><a href="#Footnote-287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a> to take but one instance,
we find six ships from Dutch ports taking out of
Sandwich port chalk to the value of £20.<a name="Anchor-288" id="Anchor-288"></a><a href="#Footnote-288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 288.">[288]</a> In the
chalk hills round Chislehurst labyrinthine galleries
of great extent bear witness to the flourishing state
of chalk-quarrying in this district in former times;<a name="Anchor-289" id="Anchor-289"></a><a href="#Footnote-289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 289.">[289]</a>
smaller quarries of a similar type exist in the
'caverns' at Guildford. Kent, Surrey, and Sussex<a name="Anchor-290" id="Anchor-290"></a><a href="#Footnote-290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a>
were indeed busily employed in quarrying chalk
during the medieval period, and for long afterwards,
down to the present day.</p>

<small>METAL WORKING</small></h2>


<p>The English craftsmen were renowned for their
metal work from the days of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan downwards.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Dunstan was the patron of the goldsmiths, his
image being one of the chief ornaments of their
gild hall in London, and a ring attributed to his
workmanship was in the possession of Edward <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr>

tongs with which he pulled the devil by the nose,
may still be seen at Mayfield. Coming to later
times and the less questionable evidence of records,
we may probably see in Otto the Goldsmith, whose
name occurs in the Domesday Survey of 1086, the
progenitor of the family of Fitz-Otho, king's goldsmiths
and masters of the Mint from 1100 to 1300.<a name="Anchor-292" id="Anchor-292"></a><a href="#Footnote-292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a>
The names of many early goldsmiths<a name="Anchor-293" id="Anchor-293"></a><a href="#Footnote-293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a> have survived,
and the beautiful candlestick given to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Peter's
Abbey at Gloucester in 1110, and now in the South
Kensington Museum, is evidence of their mastery of
the art. The great religious houses were foremost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>patrons of the craft, many of them, as the Abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Albans, numbering amongst their inmates
artists of great repute. The famous college of
Beverley included a goldsmith in its household,<a name="Anchor-294" id="Anchor-294"></a><a href="#Footnote-294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a> but
in 1292, when it was determined to erect a new
shrine for the relics of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John of Beverley, the
chapter did not entrust the work to their own
craftsman, but sent up to London to the establishment
of William Faringdon, the greatest goldsmith
of that time. The contract between his servant,
Roger of Faringdon, and the Chapter of Beverley
is still extant.<a name="Anchor-295" id="Anchor-295"></a><a href="#Footnote-295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a> By it the chapter were to provide
the necessary silver and gold; Roger was to refine
it, if needful, and to supply his own coals, quicksilver,
and other materials. The shrine was to be
5 ft. 6 in. long, 1 ft. 6 in. broad, and of proportionate
height: the design was to be architectural in style,
and the statuettes, the number and size of which
were to be at the discretion of the chapter, were to
be of cunning and beautiful work, the chapter
reserving the right to reject any figure or ornament
and cause it to be remade. For his work Roger was
to receive the weight in silver of the shrine when
completed, before gilding. No very general rule can
be laid down as to the proportion between the
intrinsic value or weight of metal and the cost of
workmanship, but roughly in the case of simple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>articles of plate the cost of manufacture may be set
at approximately half the weight. Thus in the
case of the plate presented by the city to the Black
Prince on his return from Gascony in 1371<a name="Anchor-296" id="Anchor-296"></a><a href="#Footnote-296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a> we find
six chargers, weight £14, 18s. 9d., amounting with
the making to £21, 7s. 2d.; twelve 'hanappes,'
or handled cups, weight £8, 12s., amounting to
£12, 7s. 7d.; and thirty saltcellars, weighing
£15, 6s. 2d., amounting to £21, 17s. 8d. The charge
for making silver basins and lavers in the same list
amounts to about two-thirds of the weight. The
rate appears to have remained fairly constant, as in
1416 William Randolf made four dozen chargers
and eight dozen dishes of silver for King Henry <abbr title="the fifth"><span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span></abbr>
at 30s. the pound.<a name="Anchor-297" id="Anchor-297"></a><a href="#Footnote-297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a></p>

<p>The demand for silver plate during the later
medieval period must have been brisk, for every
house of any pretension had its service of plate
standing on the cupboard or dresser. Nothing more
astonished the Venetian travellers in England in
1500 than this extraordinary profusion and display;
they noted that,<a name="Anchor-298" id="Anchor-298"></a><a href="#Footnote-298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a> 'In one single street, named the
Strand, are 52 goldsmiths' shops so rich and full
of silver vessels, great and small, that in all the
shops in Milan, Rome, Venice, and Florence put
together I do not think there would be found so
many of the magnificence that are to be seen in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>London. And these vessels are all either saltcellars
or drinking-cups or basins to hold water for the
hands, for they eat off that fine tin which is little
inferior to silver.' Although the home of the goldsmiths
is here stated to be the Strand, their chief
centre was in Lombard Street and in Cheapside,
where, just about the time that this Venetian account
was written, Thomas Wood built Goldsmiths' Row
with its ten fair houses and fourteen shops and its
four-storied front adorned with allusive wild men of
the wood riding on monstrous beasts.<a name="Anchor-299" id="Anchor-299"></a><a href="#Footnote-299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a> Even as
late as 1637 efforts were made to compel the goldsmiths
to remain in Cheapside for the greater adornment
of that thoroughfare.<a name="Anchor-300" id="Anchor-300"></a><a href="#Footnote-300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a></p>

<p>The Venetian reference to the 'fine tin' used for
plates and dishes serves to remind us that gold and
silversmiths had no monopoly of metal-working.
Pewterers, founders, and such specialised trades as
bladesmiths and spurriers played an important part
in the realm of industry, and if the materials upon
which they worked were less valuable in themselves,
the finished products were not to be despised even
from a purely artistic point of view. The figures
of Queen Eleanor of Castile and Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>, both cast
by William Torel, and those of Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> and Queen
Philippa, by Hawkin of Liége—to name but a few
obvious examples—are magnificent examples of the
founder's work. Mention may also be made of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>tomb of Richard <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr> and his queen, at which Nicholas
Croker and Godfrey Prest, coppersmiths, worked for
four years, and for which they received £700.<a name="Anchor-301" id="Anchor-301"></a><a href="#Footnote-301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a> To
deal at all fully with all the many branches of metal-working
is outside the scope of this book, but two
particular branches, the founding of bells and of
cannon, are worth treating in considerable detail.</p>

<p>References to <span class="smcap">Bells</span><a name="Anchor-302" id="Anchor-302"></a><a href="#Footnote-302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a> during Saxon times are not
infrequent, but probably the earliest notice connected
with their manufacture is the entry amongst
the tenants of Battle Abbey in the late eleventh
century of 'Ædric who cast the bells (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui signa
fundebat</i>).'<a name="Anchor-303" id="Anchor-303"></a><a href="#Footnote-303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a> It is likely that most early monastic
peals were cast in the immediate neighbourhood of
the monastery by, or under the supervision, of the
brethren. But in the twelfth century, when Ralph
Breton gave money to Rochester Cathedral Priory
for a bell, in memory of his brother, the sacrist sent
a broken bell up to London to be recast.<a name="Anchor-304" id="Anchor-304"></a><a href="#Footnote-304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a> Possibly
the craftsman who recast this bell was the Alwold
'campanarius' who was working in London about
1150.<a name="Anchor-305" id="Anchor-305"></a><a href="#Footnote-305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a> Another early bell-founder was Beneit le

is no doubt right in interpreting this founder's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>name as 'ceinturier' or girdler,<a name="Anchor-307" id="Anchor-307"></a><a href="#Footnote-307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 307.">[307]</a> for there was at
Worcester in the thirteenth century a family whose

and 'Belleyeter.'<a name="Anchor-308" id="Anchor-308"></a><a href="#Footnote-308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a> The demand for bells could
hardly have been large enough to enable a craftsman
to specialise entirely in that branch, and a bell-maker
would always have been primarily a founder,
and according as the main portion of his trade lay
in casting buckles and other fittings for belts, or
pots or bells, he would be known as a girdler, a
potter, or a bell-founder.<a name="Anchor-309" id="Anchor-309"></a><a href="#Footnote-309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 309.">[309]</a></p>

<p>The medieval English term for a bell-founder was
'bellyeter' (surviving in London as 'Billiter Street,'
the former centre of the industry), derived from the
Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">geotan</i>, to pour: the word is occasionally
found used independently as a verb, the agreement
for casting a bell for Stansfield in 1453 stipulating
that it should be 'wele and sufficiantly yette
and made.'<a name="Anchor-310" id="Anchor-310"></a><a href="#Footnote-310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 310.">[310]</a> So far as the process itself is concerned,<a name="Anchor-311" id="Anchor-311"></a><a href="#Footnote-311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311.">[311]</a>
it remained unchanged in its main features until
comparatively recent times and a considerable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>number of records relating to bell-founding have
survived and throw a little light upon the details
of the art. The first step was the formation of the
'core,' an exact model of the inside of the bell,
formed of clay. When this had been hardened by
baking, the 'thickness,' corresponding exactly to
the projected bell itself, was built up upon the core;
finally, over the 'thickness' was built a thick clay
'cope.' Originally, it would seem, it was usual to
make the 'thickness' of wax, which, melting upon
the application of heat, ran out and left the space
between the core and cope vacant for the molten
metal to flow into: possibly some of the early
uninscribed bells which still exist may have been
formed in this fashion, but it seems clear that from
the end of the thirteenth century the use of wax
was abandoned in England, the 'thickness' being
made of loam or earth.<a name="Anchor-312" id="Anchor-312"></a><a href="#Footnote-312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 312.">[312]</a> The clay cope, moulded
over this, was carefully raised by a crane, the 'thickness'
destroyed, and the cope readjusted, after any
inscription or other decoration had been stamped
on its inner surface. In order that the metal might
flow directly from the furnace into the mould the
latter lay in a pit in front of the furnace. The
furnace doors being opened, the metal, consisting of
a mixture of copper and tin, flowed into the mould.
If the metal was not in a sufficiently fluid state, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>if any check occurred the caster would 'lose his
labour and expense,' as happened to Henry Michel
when he recast the great bell of Croxden Abbey in
1313, and the work would have to be done all over
again.<a name="Anchor-313" id="Anchor-313"></a><a href="#Footnote-313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 313.">[313]</a> But if the work had been properly carried
out the completed bell had to be tuned, unless, as
was the case at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence's, Reading, in 1596,
'not so much the tune of the bell was cared for as
to have it a loud bell and heard far.'<a name="Anchor-314" id="Anchor-314"></a><a href="#Footnote-314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 314.">[314]</a></p>

<p>The tuning was done by grinding, or cutting,
down the rim of the bell if the note was too flat, or
by reducing its thickness, filing down the inner
surface of the sound bow, if the note was too sharp.
In order to reduce the amount of tuning required
it was necessary to know approximately the relation
between size, or weight, and tone, and as early as the
reign of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> a monk of Evesham, Walter of
Odyngton, devised a system by which each bell was
to weigh eight-ninths of the bell next above it in
weight.<a name="Anchor-315" id="Anchor-315"></a><a href="#Footnote-315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 315.">[315]</a> This system, delightfully simple in theory,
could not have yielded satisfactory results in practice,
and it is probable that most founders had their own
systems, based upon experience and practical observation.
The question of whether a bell was correctly
in tune with the others of the peal was one which
naturally led to occasional disputes. When Robert
Gildesburgh, brazier, of London, a fifteenth-century
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>bell-founder, cast two bells for Whitchurch in Dorset,
the vicar refused to pay for them, as he said they
were out of tune. Gildesburgh requested that they
should be submitted to the judgment of Adam
Buggeberd, rector of South Peret, who accordingly
came over and heard them rung, and decided that
there was no fault in them.<a name="Anchor-316" id="Anchor-316"></a><a href="#Footnote-316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 316.">[316]</a> In the case of the
bells recast for the church of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary-at-Hill,
London, in 1510,<a name="Anchor-317" id="Anchor-317"></a><a href="#Footnote-317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 317.">[317]</a> we have first an entry of 6½d.
paid 'for Reves labour and his brekefast for comyng
from Ludgate to Algate to here the iiij bell in
tewne'; and then, as apparently the churchwardens
were not satisfied with his report, 8d. paid 'for wyne
and peres at Skran's howse at Algate for Mr. Jentyll,
Mr. Russell, John Althorpe, John Condall and the
clarkes of saynt Antonys to go and see whether
smythes bell wer tewneabill or not.' Possibly the
decision in the case of this fourth bell cast by William
Smith was not satisfactory, as the 'great bell' seems
to have been entrusted to William Culverden, a
contemporary founder, many of whose bells, bearing
his rebus of the culver or wood pigeon, still
exist.</p>

<p>The bell having been fitted with an iron clapper,
swung from a staple inside the crown of the bell by
a leathern baudrick, was fastened on to a massive
wooden stock furnished at its ends with gudgeons,
or iron pivots, to work in the bronze sockets of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>frame, and was now ready to be hung in the belfry.
But although it was now a finished 'trade article,'
there was yet one more process to be undergone
before it could summon the faithful to church: it
was usual, though apparently by no means universal,
for the bells to be blessed. Thus the bells of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Albans Abbey were consecrated in the middle of the
twelfth century by the Bishop of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Asaph;<a name="Anchor-318" id="Anchor-318"></a><a href="#Footnote-318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 318.">[318]</a> and a
detailed account of the dedication of the great bell
called 'Jesus' at Lichfield Cathedral in 1477 has
been preserved.<a name="Anchor-319" id="Anchor-319"></a><a href="#Footnote-319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 319.">[319]</a> In the case of the five bells of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Michael's, Bishop's Stortford, recast by Reginald
Chirche of Bury <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmunds in 1489 at a cost of
£42, an extra 17s. 6d. was paid 'for their consecration
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro sanctificacione</i>).'<a name="Anchor-320" id="Anchor-320"></a><a href="#Footnote-320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 320.">[320]</a> That the dedication
ceremony included a form analogous to baptism
is clearly shown by an entry in the accounts of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Laurence, Reading, where, in 1508, we find 'paid
for hallowing the great bell named Harry 6s. 8d.
And over that Sir William Symys Richard Clich and
Mistress Smyth being godfather and godmother at
the consecracyon of the same bell, and bearing all
the costs to the suffragan.'<a name="Anchor-321" id="Anchor-321"></a><a href="#Footnote-321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 321.">[321]</a></p>

<p>Of the early centres of the industry London was
naturally the most important. Two early bell-founders
of this city have already been mentioned,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>but it is noteworthy, as showing that to a certain
extent a man might be 'jack of all trades' even if
he was master of one, that several bells were cast
for Westminster Abbey by Edward Fitz Odo, the
famous goldsmith of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr><a name="Anchor-322" id="Anchor-322"></a><a href="#Footnote-322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 322.">[322]</a> That monarch, a
patron of all the arts, granted 100s. yearly to the
Bell-ringers' gild of Westminster for ringing the
great bells.<a name="Anchor-323" id="Anchor-323"></a><a href="#Footnote-323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 323.">[323]</a> Mr. Stahlschmidt has shown that the
centre of the bell-founding trade was round Aldgate
and in the neighbourhood of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Andrew Undershaft
and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Botolph-without-Aldgate,<a name="Anchor-324" id="Anchor-324"></a><a href="#Footnote-324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 324.">[324]</a> while amongst
the more prominent early founders were the family
of Wimbish at the beginning of the fourteenth
century and the Burfords at the end of the same
century. Contemporary with these last was William
Founder, whose trade stamp, bearing his name and
a representation of two birds on a conventionalised
tree, occurs on a number of bells and hints at his real
surname, which, although it has hitherto eluded
historians, was clearly Wodeward. Mr. Stahlschmidt<a name="Anchor-325" id="Anchor-325"></a><a href="#Footnote-325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 325.">[325]</a>
noticed the entry on the Issue Rolls of
1385 recording the purchase of twelve cannon from
William the founder, but did not notice that the very
next year sixty cannon were bought from William
Wodeward,<a name="Anchor-326" id="Anchor-326"></a><a href="#Footnote-326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 326.">[326]</a> while in 1417 other cannon were provided
by William Wodeward, founder.<a name="Anchor-327" id="Anchor-327"></a><a href="#Footnote-327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 327.">[327]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Amongst the provincial centres we may notice
Gloucester, where Hugh Bellyetare occurs about
1270, and John Belyetere in 1346,<a name="Anchor-328" id="Anchor-328"></a><a href="#Footnote-328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 328.">[328]</a> the latter being
presumably the Master John of Gloucester, who
with his staff of six men came to Ely in 1342 to cast
four bells for Prior Walsingham.<a name="Anchor-329" id="Anchor-329"></a><a href="#Footnote-329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 329.">[329]</a> A later bell-founder
of some eminence at Gloucester was William
Henshawe, who was mayor in 1503, 1508, and 1509.<a name="Anchor-330" id="Anchor-330"></a><a href="#Footnote-330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 330.">[330]</a>
Another of the craft who obtained more than local
reputation was John de Stafford, mayor of Leicester
in 1366 and 1370,<a name="Anchor-331" id="Anchor-331"></a><a href="#Footnote-331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 331.">[331]</a> who was called in by the chapter
of York to cast bells for the Minster in 1371.<a name="Anchor-332" id="Anchor-332"></a><a href="#Footnote-332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 332.">[332]</a> This
is the more remarkable as York was itself a centre
of the industry, the most famous of its founders
being Richard Tunnoc, who represented the city in
Parliament in 1327, and dying in 1330, left behind
him as a worthy memorial 'the bell-maker's window'
in York Minster.<a name="Anchor-333" id="Anchor-333"></a><a href="#Footnote-333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 333.">[333]</a> In the central panel of this
window Richard Tunnoc himself is shown kneeling
before a sainted archbishop; the two other panels
show the process of bell-making. In the one the
master workman is supervising the flow of the metal
into the mould from a furnace, the draught of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>is supplied by bellows worked by two young men,
the one standing upon them with one foot on each
and the other holding the handles. The remaining
panel is usually said to represent the moulding of
the clay core, but it seems to me more likely to
represent the finishing, smoothing, and polishing
of the completed bell.<a name="Anchor-334" id="Anchor-334"></a><a href="#Footnote-334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334.">[334]</a> Richard Tunnoc is shown
seated holding a long crooked instrument (resembling
a very large boomerang), and applying it with great
care to the surface of the bell, or core, which an
assistant is rotating on a primitive lathe consisting
of two trestles and a crooked handle. The space
round each panel is filled with rows of bells swinging
in trefoiled niches.</p>

<p>The number of churches in the larger towns being
much greater in medieval times than at the present
day, and few of these churches being content with a
single bell, most of the chief towns, and in particular
those possessing cathedrals or important monasteries,
had their resident bell-founders. In the case of
Exeter, Bishop Peter de Quivil, about 1285, assured
the proper care of the bells of the cathedral by
granting a small property in Paignton to Robert
le Bellyetere as a retaining fee, Robert and his heirs
being bound to make or repair, when necessary, the
bells, organs, and clock of the cathedral, the chapter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>paying all expenses, including the food and drink
of the workmen, and these obligations were duly
fulfilled for at least three generations, Robert, son
of Walter, son of the original Robert, still holding
the land on the same terms in 1315.<a name="Anchor-335" id="Anchor-335"></a><a href="#Footnote-335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 335.">[335]</a> Canterbury
was another local centre of the trade, and from
Canterbury came the founder who in 1345 cast a
couple of bells at Dover, the one weighing 3266 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>,
and the other 1078 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, for each of which he was paid
at the rate of a halfpenny the pound.<a name="Anchor-336" id="Anchor-336"></a><a href="#Footnote-336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 336.">[336]</a> In East
Anglia there was an important foundry at the monastic
town of Bury <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmunds, one of the fifteenth-century
founders using as his trade mark a shield,
which is interesting as bearing on it not only a bell,
but also a cannon with a ball issuing from its mouth.
Norwich, again, with its seventy churches and its
cathedral priory, was a busy centre of the industry.
One of the later Norwich founders, Richard Brasier,
seems to have been more skilful than straightforward
and to have devoted some of his skill to evading
his obligations. In 1454 the churchwardens of
Stansfield bargained with him to cast a bell for their
church, half payment to be made on delivery and the
other half at the expiration of a year and a day if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the bell proved satisfactory, but if it did not he was
to cast a new bell for them; he, however, taking
advantage of their being unlearned men caused the
latter clause to be omitted from the indenture, and
when the bell proved unsatisfactory refused to make
a fresh one.<a name="Anchor-337" id="Anchor-337"></a><a href="#Footnote-337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 337.">[337]</a> A few years later, in 1468, the parishioners
of Mildenhall brought an action against
him for breach of contract. It had been agreed that
the great bell of Mildenhall should be brought by
the parishioners to 'the werkhous' of the said
Richard Brasier and weighed by them, and that
Brasier should then cast from the metal of the old
bell a new tenor bell in tune with the others then
in the church steeple, and should warrant it, as was
customary, for a year and a day, and if it were not
satisfactory should at his own expense take it back
to Norwich 'to be yoten.' They had duly carried
the bell to his workshop, but he had not cast it; in
defence his counsel urged that although they had
brought it they had not weighed it, and that until
they did so he was not bound to cast it. On the
other side it was argued that the point was frivolous,
that he could have weighed it himself, and that
indeed the indenture implied that it was to be
weighed and put into the furnace by his men in the
presence of the men of Mildenhall.<a name="Anchor-338" id="Anchor-338"></a><a href="#Footnote-338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 338.">[338]</a> A jury was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>summoned, but did not appear, and the case was
adjourned.</p>

<p>The suppression of the monasteries, followed by
the seizure of Church goods, including large numbers
of bells, formed the rude termination of the medieval
period of the industry, and may be symbolised by
the death of William Corvehill, formerly subprior
of Wenlock, 'a good bell founder and maker of the
frame for bells,' at Wenlock in 1546.<a name="Anchor-339" id="Anchor-339"></a><a href="#Footnote-339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 339.">[339]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that a cannon is shown on the shield
used as a trade mark by a fifteenth-century Suffolk
bell-founder, and the casting of <span class="smcap">Ordnance</span> may rank
with the casting of bells as one of the most interesting
and important branches of the founder's craft.
Cannon seem to have been introduced into England
at the beginning of the reign of Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> In
1339 there were in the Guildhall 'six instruments
of latten called gonnes and five roleres for the same.
Also pellets of lead weighing 4½ <abbr title="hundredweight">cwt.</abbr> for the same
instruments. Also 32 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of powder for the same.'<a name="Anchor-340" id="Anchor-340"></a><a href="#Footnote-340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 340.">[340]</a>
This same year guns are recorded to have been used
by the English at the siege of Cambrai, and they were
also used at Creçy in 1346. Two large and nine
small 'gunnes' of copper were provided for Sheppey
Castle in 1365;<a name="Anchor-341" id="Anchor-341"></a><a href="#Footnote-341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 341.">[341]</a> but whether any of these were of
native manufacture may be doubted, though a small
gun sent over to Ireland in 1360 is said to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>bought in London,<a name="Anchor-342" id="Anchor-342"></a><a href="#Footnote-342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342.">[342]</a> which does not, of course,
necessarily imply that it was made there. In 1385,
however, the sheriff of Cumberland included in his
account of repairs to the Castle of Carlisle 'costs
incurred in making three brass cannons which are
in the said castle,'<a name="Anchor-343" id="Anchor-343"></a><a href="#Footnote-343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343.">[343]</a> and in the same year 'William
Founder,' as we saw when considering his work as
a bell-founder, provided twelve guns. Next year
the same William Wodeward made no less than
sixty cannon for Calais.<a name="Anchor-344" id="Anchor-344"></a><a href="#Footnote-344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344.">[344]</a> As he was still providing
ordnance in 1416,<a name="Anchor-345" id="Anchor-345"></a><a href="#Footnote-345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345.">[345]</a> we may probably identify him
with 'Master William Gunmaker,' who made several
small cannon in 1411, two of them being of iron.<a name="Anchor-346" id="Anchor-346"></a><a href="#Footnote-346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346.">[346]</a></p>

<p>The early cannon were made of bronze of a similar
composition to that used for bells, and when iron
was introduced the cannon of that material were
made in the form of a tube composed of long iron
bars, arranged like the staves of a barrel, bound round
with iron bands. They were all breech-loaders, consisting
of two separate parts, the barrel and the
chamber; the latter being a short cylinder, usually
detachable, in which the charge of gunpowder was
placed, and which was then fastened into the base
of the barrel by means of a stirrup or similar apparatus.
Double-barrelled cannon appear to have been
fairly common, as in 1401 eight single cannon and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>six double (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">duplices</i>) were sent to Dover Castle, and
the same numbers to Scotland.<a name="Anchor-347" id="Anchor-347"></a><a href="#Footnote-347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347.">[347]</a> An inventory of
the artillery at Berwick-on-Tweed taken at the same
time<a name="Anchor-348" id="Anchor-348"></a><a href="#Footnote-348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348.">[348]</a> distinguishes between guns 'imbedded in
timber bound with iron' and 'naked' guns; it also
mentions 'two small brass guns on wooden sticks,
called handgonnes,' an early instance of small arms.
The same inventory refers to 'quarells for gonnes';
and in the previous year Henry Robertes, serjeant,
dwelling near the Guildhall, was paid £8, 8s. for
twenty-four 'quarell gunnes,'<a name="Anchor-349" id="Anchor-349"></a><a href="#Footnote-349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 349.">[349]</a> these being guns
which threw quarrels, or bolts similar to those used
with crossbows.<a name="Anchor-350" id="Anchor-350"></a><a href="#Footnote-350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 350.">[350]</a> The usual projectiles employed in
the larger guns were round stone balls, such as had
been in use for mangonels and catapults since the
days of the Romans, and these were supplied from
the quarries of Maidstone and elsewhere down to
the time of Henry <abbr title="the eighth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span></abbr> Iron 'gunstones' do not
seem to have been made much before the end of the
fifteenth century, and the 'wooden balls for cannon,'
of which there were 350 at Dover in 1387,<a name="Anchor-351" id="Anchor-351"></a><a href="#Footnote-351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351.">[351]</a> can hardly
have proved successful, but lead was commonly
employed for the smaller guns from an early date.</p>

<p>London was the chief centre of the manufacture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>of ordnance, but an iron cannon was made at Bristol
in 1408,<a name="Anchor-352" id="Anchor-352"></a><a href="#Footnote-352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352.">[352]</a> and five years later John Stevenes of Bristol
was ordered to supervise the making of another.<a name="Anchor-353" id="Anchor-353"></a><a href="#Footnote-353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 353.">[353]</a>
In 1408 'a certain great cannon newly invented by
the king himself' was made;<a name="Anchor-354" id="Anchor-354"></a><a href="#Footnote-354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354.">[354]</a> this presumably
was 'the great iron cannon called Kyngesdoughter,'
which, shortly after its birth, was broken at the siege
of 'Hardelagh.'<a name="Anchor-355" id="Anchor-355"></a><a href="#Footnote-355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355.">[355]</a> The 'Kyngesdoughter' was probably
made at the Tower, as were three other iron
cannon at the same time, four more being made in
Southwark and two smaller ones by Anthony Gunner,
possibly at Worcester as one of them was tested there
and broke during the trial; of six bronze cannon
made at the same time the largest, the 'Messager,'
weighing 4480 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and two small ones were broken
at the siege of Aberystwyth. The life of a gun in
those days seems to have been short, and that of a
gunner precarious.<a name="Anchor-356" id="Anchor-356"></a><a href="#Footnote-356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 356.">[356]</a> In 1496, when the government
range was at Mile End, 13s. 4d. was given to Blase
Ballard, gunner, 'towards his leche craft of his
hands and face lately hurte at Myles ende by fortune
shoting of a gunne,'<a name="Anchor-357" id="Anchor-357"></a><a href="#Footnote-357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 357.">[357]</a> and this is not the only hint
we have that these weapons were sometimes as
dangerous to their users as to the enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>The Germans and Dutch were particularly expert
in the manufacture of guns, and we find Matthew
de Vlenk 'gonnemaker' in the service of Richard <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>,<a name="Anchor-358" id="Anchor-358"></a><a href="#Footnote-358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 358.">[358]</a>
while Godfrey Goykyn, one of four 'gunnemeystres'
from Germany, who were serving Henry <abbr title="the fifth"><span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span></abbr> during
the last years of his reign,<a name="Anchor-359" id="Anchor-359"></a><a href="#Footnote-359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 359.">[359]</a> was employed in 1433
to finish off three great iron cannon which Walter
Thomasson had begun to make.<a name="Anchor-360" id="Anchor-360"></a><a href="#Footnote-360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 360.">[360]</a> These cannon
threw balls of fourteen, sixteen, and eighteen inches
diameter, respectively, so that presumably they
were 'bombards' or mortars, and probably similar
in type to one found in the moat of Bodiam Castle,
and now at Woolwich;<a name="Anchor-361" id="Anchor-361"></a><a href="#Footnote-361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 361.">[361]</a> the core of this specimen,
which is of 15-inch calibre, is of cast-iron, the outer
casing being formed of a series of bands of wrought
iron, and it was probably made in Sussex. It was
in this county, at Newbridge in Ashdown Forest,
that Simon Ballard in 1497 cast large quantities of
iron shot,<a name="Anchor-362" id="Anchor-362"></a><a href="#Footnote-362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 362.">[362]</a> those for 'bombardells' weighing as
much as 225 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> each, so that they had to be placed
in the guns by means of 'shotting cradles':<a name="Anchor-363" id="Anchor-363"></a><a href="#Footnote-363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363.">[363]</a> for
'curtows' the shot weighed 77 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, for 'demi-curtows'
39 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, for 'great serpentines' 19 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and
for ordinary 'serpentines' 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> This same Simon
Ballard was enrolled amongst the gunners at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>time of the Cornish rising under Perkin Warbeck.<a name="Anchor-364" id="Anchor-364"></a><a href="#Footnote-364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 364.">[364]</a>
In the same way we find 'Pieter Robard alias Graunte
Pierre,' ironfounder of Hartfield,<a name="Anchor-365" id="Anchor-365"></a><a href="#Footnote-365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 365.">[365]</a> described as a
'gonner,' and casting 'pellettes' at 6d. a day in
1497.<a name="Anchor-366" id="Anchor-366"></a><a href="#Footnote-366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 366.">[366]</a> In this same year ten 'faucons' (small guns
which fired balls of about 2 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>) were made by
William Frese,<a name="Anchor-367" id="Anchor-367"></a><a href="#Footnote-367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 367.">[367]</a> founder, at 10s. the hundredweight,
and eight faucons of brass were made by William
Newport,<a name="Anchor-368" id="Anchor-368"></a><a href="#Footnote-368" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 368.">[368]</a> who was a London bell-founder,<a name="Anchor-369" id="Anchor-369"></a><a href="#Footnote-369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 369.">[369]</a> while
John Crowchard repaired an old serpentyne that

for the touche holes of diverse gonnes with 5 oliettes
and fourteen staples,' weighing 53 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> at 2d. the
pound, and also '7 bandes of yren made for the great
gonnes mouthes.'<a name="Anchor-370" id="Anchor-370"></a><a href="#Footnote-370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 370.">[370]</a> Cornelys Arnoldson at the same
time was paid for mending five great serpentynes
and making two new chambers to them, for '5 forelocks
with cheynes to the said gonnes,' for 'handills

and dressing' the guns.<a name="Anchor-371" id="Anchor-371"></a><a href="#Footnote-371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 371.">[371]</a></p>

<p>At the beginning of the reign of Henry <abbr title="the eighth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span></abbr> large
purchases of cannon were made abroad, from Hans
Popenreuter and Lewis de la Fava of Mechlin, from
Stephen of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Iago, from Fortuno de Catalengo,
and from John Cavalcante of Florence, who also,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>in return for a grant of alum, agreed to import
saltpetre to the value of £2400.<a name="Anchor-372" id="Anchor-372"></a><a href="#Footnote-372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 372.">[372]</a> But the English
foundries were not idle: Humphrey Walker, a
London gunfounder, supplied fifty pieces of ordnance,
at 12s. the pound, as well as much shot,<a name="Anchor-373" id="Anchor-373"></a><a href="#Footnote-373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373.">[373]</a> while
Cornelys Johnson 'gonnemaker,' made and repaired
ordnance for the navy.<a name="Anchor-374" id="Anchor-374"></a><a href="#Footnote-374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374.">[374]</a> John Atkynson, another
founder, in 1514 was paid 2s. 'for 8 lodes of clay to
make molds for a great gun chamber' and a further
8d. for 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of hair 'to temper the clay withall';
he was also supplied with latten and iron wire, and
John Dowson made certain iron work, including
'a rounde plate for the bottom of the chambre, in
length 4½ feet, with 10 rounde hookes; a rounde
plate with a crosse for the mouthe of the chambre;
36 bandes of 4 foot in length for to wrapp the chambre

a quespile,' etc.<a name="Anchor-375" id="Anchor-375"></a><a href="#Footnote-375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 375.">[375]</a></p>

<p>The medieval period of gunfounding came to an
end with the discovery, about 1543, of a method of
casting iron cannon in the entire piece—then boring
them. This discovery is usually attributed to Ralph
Hogge of Buxted and Peter Baude, his French
assistant, and resulted in the ironmaking districts
of the Weald of Sussex and Kent becoming the chief
centre of the manufacture of ordnance.<a name="Anchor-376" id="Anchor-376"></a><a href="#Footnote-376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 376.">[376]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr><br />

<small>POTTERY—TILES, BRICKS</small></h2>


<p>The manufacture of earthen vessels was one of the
earliest, as it was one of the most widespread industries.
From the end of the Stone Age onwards
wherever suitable clay was to be found, the potter
plied his trade. The Romans, who had brought
the art of potting to a high pitch of excellence,
introduced improved methods into Britain, where
numerous remains of kilns and innumerable fragments
of pottery testify to the industry and the
individuality of the Romano-British potters.
Several quite distinct types of pottery have been
identified and are assignable to definite localities.
Great quantities of black and grey wares, consisting
of articles of common domestic use, ornamented for
the most part only with broad bands of darker or
lighter shading, were made in Kent near the Medway,
the finer specimens being associated with Upchurch.
From the potteries in the New Forest<a name="Anchor-377" id="Anchor-377"></a><a href="#Footnote-377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377.">[377]</a> came vases
of greater ornamental and artistic execution, but it
was the neighbourhood of Castor in Northamptonshire
that occupied in Roman times the place held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>in recent times by Staffordshire. Round Castor
numbers of kilns have been found,<a name="Anchor-378" id="Anchor-378"></a><a href="#Footnote-378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378.">[378]</a> and the peculiar
dark ware, with its self-coloured slip decoration,
occurs all over England, and also on the Continent.</p>

<p>Romano-British kilns have been found in a great
number of places, some of the best preserved being
at Castor,<a name="Anchor-379" id="Anchor-379"></a><a href="#Footnote-379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379.">[379]</a> in London,<a name="Anchor-380" id="Anchor-380"></a><a href="#Footnote-380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380.">[380]</a> at Colchester,<a name="Anchor-381" id="Anchor-381"></a><a href="#Footnote-381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381.">[381]</a> Radlett
(Herts.),<a name="Anchor-382" id="Anchor-382"></a><a href="#Footnote-382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 382.">[382]</a> and Shepton Mallet (Somerset).<a name="Anchor-383" id="Anchor-383"></a><a href="#Footnote-383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383.">[383]</a> Speaking
generally they consisted of a circular pit, about
4 to 6 feet in diameter, dug out to a depth of about
4 feet: in this was a flat clay floor raised some
2 feet from the bottom of the pit by a central
pedestal. Into the space between this floor, or
table, and the bottom of the pit came the hot air
and smoke from a small furnace built at one side
of the pit, or kiln proper. On the clay table, which
was pierced with holes for the passage of the heat
and smoke, were ranged the clay vessels to be baked,
and these were built up in layers of diminishing
diameter into a domed or conical structure, the
layers being separated by grass covered with clay,
the whole was then covered in with clay, leaving
only an aperture in the centre at the top,<a name="Anchor-384" id="Anchor-384"></a><a href="#Footnote-384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384.">[384]</a> and the
furnace lighted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The early medieval kilns appear to have been
very similar in construction to those just described,
or of even simpler construction. If we may take
literally the statement that a potter at Skipton paid
6s. 8d. in 1323 'for dead wood and undergrowth to
burn round his pots'<a name="Anchor-385" id="Anchor-385"></a><a href="#Footnote-385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385.">[385]</a> it would seem that here a
primitive combination of furnace and kiln in one was
in use. At a later date the usual construction was
probably something similar to those found at
Ringmer, in Sussex,<a name="Anchor-386" id="Anchor-386"></a><a href="#Footnote-386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">[386]</a> which seem to belong to the
fifteenth century. Here the kilns were built of
bricks or blocks of clay cemented by a sandy loam
which vitrified under the influence of the heat to
which it was subjected. The beds of the kilns
enclosed longitudinal passages covered in with
narrow arches, the spaces between which served to
transmit the hot air to the superimposed clay vessels.
The hearths were charged through arched openings
at their ends with charcoal fuel.</p>

<p>To render the pottery non-porous, it was necessary
to glaze it,<a name="Anchor-387" id="Anchor-387"></a><a href="#Footnote-387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387.">[387]</a> and from an early period lead has
been used for this purpose. A twelfth-century
description of the process says<a name="Anchor-388" id="Anchor-388"></a><a href="#Footnote-388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388.">[388]</a> that the surface of
the vase is first to be moistened with water in which
flour has been boiled, and then powdered with lead:
it is then placed inside a larger vessel and baked at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>a gentle heat. This process gives a yellow glaze,
but if green is required—and green was the colour
most often used in England in the medieval period—copper
or bronze was to be added to the lead.
The same authority gives a recipe for a leadless
glaze: baked potter's earth is powdered and washed
and then mixed with half its weight of unbaked
earth, containing no sand; this is then worked up
with oil and painted over the surface of the vase.</p>

<p>Potters are mentioned at Bladon (Oxon.), Hasfield
(Gloucs.), and Westbury (Wilts.), in Domesday,<a name="Anchor-389" id="Anchor-389"></a><a href="#Footnote-389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389.">[389]</a>
but apart from casual references in place names<a name="Anchor-390" id="Anchor-390"></a><a href="#Footnote-390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390.">[390]</a>
and in descriptions of individuals<a name="Anchor-391" id="Anchor-391"></a><a href="#Footnote-391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 391.">[391]</a> the documentary
history of early English pottery is scanty. Kingston
on Thames may have been an early centre of the
trade, as in 1260 the bailiffs of that town were
ordered to send a thousand pitchers to the king's
butler at Westminster.<a name="Anchor-392" id="Anchor-392"></a><a href="#Footnote-392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 392.">[392]</a> At Graffham, in Sussex,
in 1341, one of the sources of the vicar's income was
'a composition from the men who made clay pots,
which is worth 12d.,'<a name="Anchor-393" id="Anchor-393"></a><a href="#Footnote-393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 393.">[393]</a> but the most common form
of entry is a record of sums paid by potters for leave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>to dig clay. Thus at Cowick in Yorkshire,<a name="Anchor-394" id="Anchor-394"></a><a href="#Footnote-394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 394.">[394]</a> in 1374,
as much as £4, 16s. was 'received from potters
making earthen vessels, for clay and sand taken in
the moor of Cowick.' Similar entries occur here
every year for about a century, while at Ringmer,
in Sussex, small dues of 9d. a head were paid yearly
by some half a dozen potters for a period of well
over two hundred years.<a name="Anchor-395" id="Anchor-395"></a><a href="#Footnote-395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 395.">[395]</a> Still earlier, in 1283, a
rent of 36s. 8d., called 'Potteresgavel,' was paid
to the lord of the manor of Midhurst.<a name="Anchor-396" id="Anchor-396"></a><a href="#Footnote-396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 396.">[396]</a></p>

<p>The type of pottery produced does not seem to
have varied to any great extent in the different
districts.<a name="Anchor-397" id="Anchor-397"></a><a href="#Footnote-397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 397.">[397]</a> At Lincoln it seems to have been the
custom to decorate some of the vessels by means of
stamps: some of these stamps, in the form of heads,
may be seen in the British Museum. But the use
of stamps for decorating pottery is found also at
Hastings. One distinctive variety of earthenware,
however, arose about the beginning of the sixteenth
century: it is a thin hard pottery, dark brown in
colour, well glazed, and usually decorated with
elaborate patterns in white slip. From its being
found in large quantities in the Cistercian abbeys
of Yorkshire—Kirkstall, Jervaulx, and Fountains—it
has received the name of 'Cistercian ware,' but
there is at present no direct evidence of its place of
manufacture.<a name="Anchor-398" id="Anchor-398"></a><a href="#Footnote-398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 398.">[398]</a></p>

<p>Closely connected with pottery is the manufacture
of <span class="smcap">Tiles</span>, the material being in each case clay, and
the kilns used being practically identical. At what
period the manufacture of tiles, which had ceased
with the Roman occupation, was resumed in England
is not certain, but from the beginning of the thirteenth
century they play an increasing part in the records
of building operations. The frequency and devastating
effect of fires, where thatched roofs were in
use, soon led to the use of tiles for roofing purposes
in towns even when the authorities did not make
their use compulsory, as was done in London in
1212, and at a much later date, in 1509, at Norwich.<a name="Anchor-399" id="Anchor-399"></a><a href="#Footnote-399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 399.">[399]</a>
The importance, for the safety of the town, of having
a large supply of tiles accessible at a low price was
recognised, and in 1350, after the Black Death had
sent the prices of labour and of manufactured goods
up very high, the City Council of London fixed the
maximum price of tiles at 5s. the thousand,<a name="Anchor-400" id="Anchor-400"></a><a href="#Footnote-400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400.">[400]</a> and in
1362, when a great tempest had unroofed numbers
of houses and created a great demand for tiles, they
ordered that the price of tiles should not be raised,
and that the manufacturers should continue to make
tiles as usual and expose them for sale, not keeping
them back to enhance the price.<a name="Anchor-401" id="Anchor-401"></a><a href="#Footnote-401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 401.">[401]</a> It was probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>the same appreciation of the public advantage that
led the authorities at Worcester in the fifteenth
century to forbid the tilers to form any gild, or trade
union, to restrain strangers from working in the city,
or to fix a rate of wages.<a name="Anchor-402" id="Anchor-402"></a><a href="#Footnote-402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 402.">[402]</a></p>

<p>The Worcester regulations also ordered that all
tiles should be marked with the maker's sign, so
that any defects in size or quality could be traced
to the party responsible. Earlier in the same century,
in 1425, there had been many complaints at
Colchester of the lack of uniformity in the size of
the tiles made there,<a name="Anchor-403" id="Anchor-403"></a><a href="#Footnote-403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 403.">[403]</a> and at last it became necessary
in 1477 to pass an Act of Parliament to regulate the
manufacture.<a name="Anchor-404" id="Anchor-404"></a><a href="#Footnote-404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404.">[404]</a> By this Act it was provided that
the clay to be used should be dug, or cast, by 1st
November, that it should be stirred and turned
before the beginning of February, and not made into
tiles before March, so as to ensure its being properly
seasoned. Care was to be taken to avoid any
admixture of chalk or marl or stones. The standard
for plain tiles should be 10½ inches by 6¼ inches
with a thickness of at least ⅝ inch; ridge tiles or
crests should be 13½ inches by 6¼, and gutter tiles
10½ inches long, and of sufficient thickness and depth.
Searchers were to be appointed and paid a penny on
every thousand plain tiles, a half-penny on every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>hundred crests, and a farthing for every hundred
corner and gutter tiles examined. Infringement of
the regulation entailed fines of 5s. the thousand
plain, 6s. 8d. the hundred crest, and 2s. the hundred
corner or gutter tiles sold. 'The size of the tiles
is probably a declaration of the custom, the fine
is the price at which each kind was ordinarily sold
in the fifteenth century.'<a name="Anchor-405" id="Anchor-405"></a><a href="#Footnote-405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405.">[405]</a></p>

<p>These regulations throw a certain amount of light
upon the processes employed in tile-making, and
further details are obtainable from the series of
accounts relating to the great tileworks in the Kentish
manor of Wye,<a name="Anchor-406" id="Anchor-406"></a><a href="#Footnote-406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 406.">[406]</a> extending from 1330 to 1380. In
1355 the output of ten kilns (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furni</i>) was 98,500 plain,
or flat, tiles, 500 'festeux'<a name="Anchor-407" id="Anchor-407"></a><a href="#Footnote-407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 407.">[407]</a> (either ridge or gutter
tiles), and 1000 'corners.' The digging of the clay
and burning of the kilns was contracted for at 11s.
the kiln, a thousand faggots were bought for fuel<a name="Anchor-408" id="Anchor-408"></a><a href="#Footnote-408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 408.">[408]</a>
at a cost of 45s., and another 10s. was spent on
carriage of the clay and faggots. The total expenses
were therefore £8, 5s., and as plain tiles sold here for
2s. 6d. the thousand, festeux at three farthings each,
and corners at 1s. 8d. the hundred, the value of the
output was about £14, 15s. In 1370, when thirteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>kilns belonging to two tileries turned out 168,000
plain tiles, 650 festeux, and 900 corners, we have a
more elaborate account. Wood was cut at the rate
of 15d. for each kiln; clay for the six kilns of one
tilery was 'cast' at 14d. the kiln and 'tempered'
at the rate of 1s. 6d., but for the seven kilns of the
other tilery payment was made in grain. The clay
was carried to the six kilns for 4s., and prepared<a name="Anchor-409" id="Anchor-409"></a><a href="#Footnote-409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 409.">[409]</a> for
moulding into tiles for 7s.; the actual making and
burning<a name="Anchor-410" id="Anchor-410"></a><a href="#Footnote-410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 410.">[410]</a> of the tiles was paid for at 14s. the kiln, and
an extra 12d. were given as gratuities to the tilers.
Next year the output was considerably reduced,
because in one tilery 'the upper course of the kilns
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cursus furni</i>) did not bake the tiles fully, nor will it
bake them until extensive repairs are done,' and in
the other tilery only four kilns were prepared, and
one of these had to be left unburnt until the next
year, owing to the lack of workmen. It was possibly
for the defective kiln just mentioned that a 'new
vault' was made in 1373 at a cost of 6s. 8d.—with
a further 8d. for obtaining loam (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">limo</i>) for the work.
Two years later repairs were done to the buildings
of a tilery, which had been blown down by the wind.
But the chief blow was struck to the industry here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>by the increasing difficulty of obtaining workmen.
The work may have been unhealthy, for it is noteworthy
that the Ringmer potters were on more than
one occasion wiped out by pestilence:<a name="Anchor-411" id="Anchor-411"></a><a href="#Footnote-411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 411.">[411]</a> the effects
of the Black Death in 1350 on the Wye tilers are not
recorded, but in 1366 as a result, apparently, of the
second pestilence two small tileries, one of three
roods, and the other of 1½ acres, which had been
leased for 7d. and 14d. respectively, lost their tenants,
and in 1375 mention is made of the scarcity of workmen,
'who died in the pestilence at the time of
tile making.' In 1377 Peter at Gate,<a name="Anchor-412" id="Anchor-412"></a><a href="#Footnote-412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 412.">[412]</a> who for the
past few years had hired a number of kilns at 20s.
a piece, only answered for four kilns 'on account of
hindrance to the workmen, who had been assigned
to guard the sea coast, and on account of the great
quantity of rain in the autumn, which did not allow
him to burn more kilns.' In the same year, and also
two years later, another tilery was unworked for
lack of labour.</p>

<p>The tileries at Wye belonged to the Abbot of
Battle, and there were tile kilns at Battle itself in
the sixteenth century,<a name="Anchor-413" id="Anchor-413"></a><a href="#Footnote-413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 413.">[413]</a> and probably much earlier,
as in the adjoining parish of Ashburnham in 1362,
there was a 'building called a Tylehous for baking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">siccandis</i>) tiles.'<a name="Anchor-414" id="Anchor-414"></a><a href="#Footnote-414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 414.">[414]</a> Just about the same time, in
1363, we find 'a piece of land called Teghelerehelde'
in Hackington,<a name="Anchor-415" id="Anchor-415"></a><a href="#Footnote-415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 415.">[415]</a> close to Canterbury, granted to
Christian Belsire, in whose family it remained for
over a century, as in 1465 William Belsyre leased to
John Appys and Edmund Helere of Canterbury 'a
tyleoste with a workhouse' lying at Tylernehelde
in Hackington for two years for a rent of 26s. 8d.<a name="Anchor-416" id="Anchor-416"></a><a href="#Footnote-416" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 416.">[416]</a>
With the 'tyleoste' William Belsyre handed over
15,000 'tyle standardes'—worth 18d. the thousand,
eighty 'palette bordes and three long bordys for
the kelle walles.'<a name="Anchor-417" id="Anchor-417"></a><a href="#Footnote-417" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 417.">[417]</a> Various building accounts show
that there were extensive tileries at Smithfield; for
Guildford Castle the tiles came from Shalford, and
for Windsor chiefly from 'la Penne.' In the north
tiles were made before the end of the thirteenth
century at Hull, amongst other places, but one of
the chief centres was Beverley. About 1385 the
monks of Meaux complained that 'certain workmen
of Beverley who were called tilers, makers and
burners of the slabs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laterum</i>) with which many
houses in Beverley and elsewhere are covered,' had
trespassed on the abbey's lands at Waghen and
Sutton, taking away clay between the banks and the
stream of the river Hull without leave, to convert
into tiles. The monks seized their tools, their oars,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>and finally one of their boats, but the Provost of
Beverley, on whose fee the tileries were, supported
the tilers in their claim to dig clay in any place
covered by the waters of the Hull at its highest.<a name="Anchor-418" id="Anchor-418"></a><a href="#Footnote-418" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 418.">[418]</a>
Some thirty years earlier, in 1359, the list of customary
town dues at Beverley included 'from every tiler's
furnace fired ½d.,'<a name="Anchor-419" id="Anchor-419"></a><a href="#Footnote-419" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 419.">[419]</a> and in 1370 Thomas Whyt, tiler,
took a lease of the tilery of Aldebek from the town
authorities for four years, at a rent of 6000 tiles.<a name="Anchor-420" id="Anchor-420"></a><a href="#Footnote-420" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 420.">[420]</a></p>

<p>So far we have been dealing with roofing tiles,
or 'thakketyles,' but from the middle of the fourteenth
century onwards with increasing frequency,
we find mention of 'waltyles' or bricks. For
building a new chamber at Ely in 1335 some 18,000
wall tiles (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tegularum muralium</i>) were made at a cost
of 12d. the thousand.<a name="Anchor-421" id="Anchor-421"></a><a href="#Footnote-421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 421.">[421]</a> They seem to have been
introduced from Flanders, and are frequently called
'Flaundrestiell,'<a name="Anchor-422" id="Anchor-422"></a><a href="#Footnote-422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 422.">[422]</a> as, for instance, in 1357, when a
thousand were bought for a fireplace at Westminster
at 3s. 2d.<a name="Anchor-423" id="Anchor-423"></a><a href="#Footnote-423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 423.">[423]</a> At Beverley, in 1391, three persons
acquired from the gild of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John the right to take
earth at Groval Dyke, paying yearly therefor
3000 'waltyles,'<a name="Anchor-424" id="Anchor-424"></a><a href="#Footnote-424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 424.">[424]</a> and in 1440 Robert Collard, tile-maker,
took 'le Grovaldyke on the west side of le
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>demmyng' at a rent of 1000 'waltyl.'<a name="Anchor-425" id="Anchor-425"></a><a href="#Footnote-425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 425.">[425]</a> It was
probably more particularly with regard to brick
kilns than to ordinary tile kilns that the regulations
drawn up in 1461<a name="Anchor-426" id="Anchor-426"></a><a href="#Footnote-426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 426.">[426]</a> ordered that, 'on account of the
stench, fouling the air and destruction of fruit trees,
no one is to make a kiln to burn tile nearer the town
than the kilns now are, under penalty of a fine of
100s.' The term 'brick' does not seem to have
come into common use much before 1450, about
which time the use of the material became general.</p>

<p>In addition to roof tiles and wall tiles, there were
floor tiles. References to these occur in many
building accounts. At Windsor, in 1368, 'paven-tyll'
cost 4s. the thousand, and a large variety 2s.
the hundred, while plain roof tiles were 2s. 6d. the
thousand.<a name="Anchor-427" id="Anchor-427"></a><a href="#Footnote-427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 427.">[427]</a> These were probably plain red tiles,
but at Westminster in 1278 we have mention of the
purchase of 'a quarter and a half of yellow tiles'
for 7d.<a name="Anchor-428" id="Anchor-428"></a><a href="#Footnote-428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 428.">[428]</a> Tiles with a plain yellow or green glazed
surface are of common occurrence in medieval
buildings, and in many churches and monastic
ruins pavements of inlaid, so-called 'encaustic,'
tiles remain more or less complete.<a name="Anchor-429" id="Anchor-429"></a><a href="#Footnote-429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 429.">[429]</a> In the case of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>these inlaid tiles the pattern was impressed or
incised before baking, and then filled in with white
slip, the whole being usually glazed. Some of the
patterns thus produced were of great beauty and
elaboration, and it would seem that they were often
designed, if not actually made, by members of
monastic houses. The finest known series are those
discovered at Chertsey Abbey, and it is possible
that the remarkable examples in the chapter-house
of Westminster Abbey,<a name="Anchor-430" id="Anchor-430"></a><a href="#Footnote-430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 430.">[430]</a> which date from <i>c.</i> 1255,
are by the same artist. In the case of the Abbey of
Dale in Derbyshire,<a name="Anchor-431" id="Anchor-431"></a><a href="#Footnote-431" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 431.">[431]</a> and the priories of Repton and
Malvern,<a name="Anchor-432" id="Anchor-432"></a><a href="#Footnote-432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 432.">[432]</a> the kilns used for making these inlaid
tiles have been discovered, and similar kilns, not
associated, so far as is known, with any religious
establishment, have also been found at Hastings.<a name="Anchor-433" id="Anchor-433"></a><a href="#Footnote-433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 433.">[433]</a>
The manufacture of these inlaid tiles in England
gradually died out towards the end of the fifteenth
century, and has only been revived in recent years.</p>

<p>It is curious that although there is abundant
circumstantial evidence of <span class="smcap">Glassmaking</span> in England,
during the medieval period, direct records of the
manufacture are extremely scarce, and practically
confined to a single district. From the early years
of the thirteenth century, Chiddingfold and the
neighbouring villages on the borders of Surrey and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>Sussex were turning out large quantities of glass.
Laurence 'Vitrarius' (the glassman) occurs as a
landed proprietor in Chiddingfold about 1225, and
some fifty years later there is a casual reference to
'le Ovenhusfeld,' presumably the field in which was
the oven or furnace house, of which the remains
were uncovered some years since.<a name="Anchor-434" id="Anchor-434"></a><a href="#Footnote-434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 434.">[434]</a> It is possible
that in the case of glassmaking, as in the case of
many other industries, improvements were introduced
from abroad, for in 1352 we find John de
Alemaygne<a name="Anchor-435" id="Anchor-435"></a><a href="#Footnote-435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 435.">[435]</a> of Chiddingfold supplying large quantities
of glass for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's Chapel, Westminster.<a name="Anchor-436" id="Anchor-436"></a><a href="#Footnote-436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 436.">[436]</a>
In one batch he sent up three hundred and three
weys (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pondera</i>) of glass, the wey being 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>, and the
hundred consisting of twenty-four weys, being, that
is to say, the 'long hundred' of 120 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> A little
later he sent thirty-six weys, and soon after another
sixty weys were bought at Chiddingfold, probably
from the same maker. The price in each case was
6d. the wey, or 12s. the hundred, to which had to be
added about 1d. the wey for carriage from the
Weald to Westminster. In January 1355-6 four
hundreds of glass were bought from the same maker
for the windows of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George's Chapel, Windsor,
at 13s. 4d. the hundred.<a name="Anchor-437" id="Anchor-437"></a><a href="#Footnote-437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 437.">[437]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards the end of the fourteenth century the
family of Sherterre, or Shorter, became prominent
in the Chiddingfold district,<a name="Anchor-438" id="Anchor-438"></a><a href="#Footnote-438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 438.">[438]</a> and on the death of
John Sherterre in 1380 his widow engaged John
Glasewryth, of Staffordshire, to work the glass-house
for six years, receiving 20d. for every sheaf
(<i>sheu</i>)<a name="Anchor-439" id="Anchor-439"></a><a href="#Footnote-439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 439.">[439]</a> of 'brodeglass' (<i>i.e.</i> window glass), and 6d.
for every hundred of glass vessels made. This is
interesting as showing that glass vessels were made
here; the evidence of inventories, however, seems
to show that glass was as a whole very little used
for table purposes, though a few pieces of the beautiful
Italian glassware might be found in the houses
of the wealthy. The family of Shorter were succeeded
by the Ropleys, and they in turn by the
Peytos, who carried on the trade during the whole
of the sixteenth century, and as late as 1614, thus
well overlapping the modern period of glassmaking,
which began with the coming of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gentilshommes
verriers</i> from France early in the reign of Elizabeth.<a name="Anchor-440" id="Anchor-440"></a><a href="#Footnote-440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 440.">[440]</a></p>

<p>Glass must have been made in many other districts
where fuel and sand, the chief requisites for
the manufacture, were plentiful, but it is difficult
to identify any sites of the industry. In 1352 John
Geddyng, glazier, was sent into Kent and Essex to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>glass for <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's, Westminster,<a name="Anchor-441" id="Anchor-441"></a><a href="#Footnote-441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 441.">[441]</a> but where he
went and whether he was successful, is not known.
'English glass' is found in use at Durham in 1397,<a name="Anchor-442" id="Anchor-442"></a><a href="#Footnote-442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 442.">[442]</a>
and at York in 1471.<a name="Anchor-443" id="Anchor-443"></a><a href="#Footnote-443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 443.">[443]</a> For York Minster sixteen
sheets (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tabulae</i>) of English glass were bought from
Edmund Bordale of Bramley buttes for 14s. 8d. in
1478,<a name="Anchor-444" id="Anchor-444"></a><a href="#Footnote-444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 444.">[444]</a> and at an earlier date, in 1418, we find three
seams, three weys of white glass bought from John
Glasman of Ruglay (Rugeley) at 20s. the seam
of twenty-four weys,<a name="Anchor-445" id="Anchor-445"></a><a href="#Footnote-445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 445.">[445]</a> but whether these men
were glass makers, or merely glass merchants,
cannot be determined. That the industry, so far
at least as real stained glass is concerned, was not
flourishing in England in the fifteenth century is
shown by the fact that Henry <abbr title="the sixth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VI.</span></abbr>, in 1449, brought
over from Flanders John Utynam to make glass of
all colours for Eton College and the College of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Mary and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Nicholas (<i>i.e.</i> King's) Cambridge. He
was empowered to obtain workmen and materials
at the King's cost, and full protection was granted
to him and his family. He was also allowed to sell
such glass as he made at his own expense, and 'because
the said art has never been used in England,
and the said John is to instruct divers in many other
arts never used in the realm,' the King granted him
a monopoly, no one else being allowed to use such
arts for twenty years without his licence under a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>penalty of £200.<a name="Anchor-446" id="Anchor-446"></a><a href="#Footnote-446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 446.">[446]</a> Most glass of which we have any
account was bought through the glaziers of the larger
towns; but to what extent they made their own
glass we cannot say. A certain amount, especially
of coloured glass, was imported, and the York
accounts show 'glass of various colours' bought in
1457 from Peter Faudkent, 'Dochman' (<i>i.e.</i> German),
at Hull,<a name="Anchor-447" id="Anchor-447"></a><a href="#Footnote-447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 447.">[447]</a> 'Rennysshe' glass bought in 1530, Burgundy
glass in 1536, and Normandy glass in 1537,<a name="Anchor-448" id="Anchor-448"></a><a href="#Footnote-448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 448.">[448]</a>
while in 1447 we find the executors of the Earl of
Warwick stipulating that no English glass should
be used in the windows of his chapel at Warwick.<a name="Anchor-449" id="Anchor-449"></a><a href="#Footnote-449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 449.">[449]</a></p>

<p>To any one who knows the beauty of English
stained glass this stipulation may seem strange, but
it must be borne in mind that our cathedral windows
derive their glories not from the maker, but from
the painter, and that the glass is but the medium
carrying the designs of the artist. English glass as
a rule, prior at any rate to the fifteenth century, was
white and received its decoration after it had left
the glass-house. The process may be gathered from
the account of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Stephen's in 1352. Here we find
John of Chester and five other master glaziers
employed at a shilling a day drawing designs for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>windows on 'white tables,' presumably flat wooden
tablets, which were washed with ale,<a name="Anchor-450" id="Anchor-450"></a><a href="#Footnote-450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 450.">[450]</a> which served
no doubt as a size or medium to prevent the colours
running. About a dozen glaziers were employed at
7d. a day to paint the glass, and some fifteen, at 6d.
a day, to cut or break the glass and join it,<a name="Anchor-451" id="Anchor-451"></a><a href="#Footnote-451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 451.">[451]</a> which
they apparently did by placing it over the painted
designs, this being presumably done before it was
painted. The glass thus cut into convenient shapes
was held in place over the design by 'clozyngnailles,'
and when it had been painted was joined up with
leads, lard or grease being used to fill the joints.
For the painting silver foil, gum arabick, jet (<i>geet</i>),
and 'arnement' (a kind of ink) were provided.<a name="Anchor-452" id="Anchor-452"></a><a href="#Footnote-452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 452.">[452]</a>
Possibly the stronger colours were supplied by the
use of pieces of stained glass, as purchases were
made of ruby, azure, and sapphire glass.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr><br />

<small>CLOTHMAKING</small></h2>


<p>Important as was the wool trade, for centuries the
main source of England's wealth, its history, pertaining
to the realms of commerce rather than of
industry, does not concern us here, and we may
ignore the raw material to deal with the manufactured
article. To treat at all adequately the
vast and complicated history of clothmaking would
require a volume as large as this book, even if the
line be drawn at the introduction of the New
Draperies by Protestant refugees in the time of
Elizabeth, and all that is possible here is briefly to
outline that history.</p>

<p>The weaving of cloth is of prehistoric antiquity,
implements employed therein having been found
in numbers in the ancient lake-village of Glastonbury,
and on other earlier sites, but documentary
evidence may be said to begin with the twelfth
century. By the middle of that century the industry
had so far developed in certain centres that
the weavers of London, Winchester, Lincoln, Oxford,
Huntingdon, and Nottingham, and the fullers of
Winchester, had formed themselves into gilds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>which were sufficiently wealthy to pay from 40s. to
£12 yearly to the king for various privileges which
practically amounted to the monopoly of cloth-working
in their several districts.<a name="Anchor-453" id="Anchor-453"></a><a href="#Footnote-453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 453.">[453]</a> If these were the
principal they were by no means the only centres
of the industry. Stamford,<a name="Anchor-454" id="Anchor-454"></a><a href="#Footnote-454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 454.">[454]</a> on the borders of
Lincolnshire and Northants., was another; and
Gloucester,<a name="Anchor-455" id="Anchor-455"></a><a href="#Footnote-455" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 455.">[455]</a> while dyers are found at Worcester<a name="Anchor-456" id="Anchor-456"></a><a href="#Footnote-456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 456.">[456]</a> in
1173, and at Darlington<a name="Anchor-457" id="Anchor-457"></a><a href="#Footnote-457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 457.">[457]</a> ten years later.</p>

<p>To the twelfth century also belong the remarkable
'laws of the weavers and fullers' of Winchester,
Marlborough, Oxford, and Beverley.<a name="Anchor-458" id="Anchor-458"></a><a href="#Footnote-458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 458.">[458]</a> These, which
all closely resemble one another, and were either
based upon, or intimately related to the regulations
in force in London, show the clothworkers in a state
of subjection for which it is difficult to account.
Briefly summarised, they lay down that no weaver
or fuller may traffic in cloth or sell it to any one
except to the merchants of the town, and that if
any became prosperous and wished to become a
freeman of the town, he must first abandon his
trade and get rid of all the implements connected
with it, and then satisfy the town officials of his
ability to keep up his new position without working
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>at his old trade. But the most singular provision,
found in all these laws, was that no fuller or weaver
could attaint or bear witness against a 'free man.'
Here it is clear that 'free man' is used not as opposed
to a villein,<a name="Anchor-459" id="Anchor-459"></a><a href="#Footnote-459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 459.">[459]</a> but as implying one possessing the full
franchise of his town, in other words, a member of
the governing merchant gild, or equivalent body.
Probably the English cloth trade, which was very
extensive during the twelfth century, was entirely
in the hands of the capitalist merchant clothiers, at
any rate so far as the great towns here in question
were concerned, and they had combined to prevent
members of the handicraft gilds of clothworkers
from obtaining access to the merchant gilds. As the
charter granted to the London weavers by Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>
early in his reign confirms to them the rights and
privileges which they had in the time of Henry <abbr title="the first"><span class="smcap lowercase">I.</span></abbr>,
and orders that no one shall dare to do them any
injury or despite,<a name="Anchor-460" id="Anchor-460"></a><a href="#Footnote-460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 460.">[460]</a> it may be suggested that these
restrictive regulations were drawn up in the time of
Stephen. For the date at which they were collected,
evidently as precedents for use in London, we may
hazard 1202, in which year the citizens of London
paid sixty marks to King John to abolish the
weavers' gilds.<a name="Anchor-461" id="Anchor-461"></a><a href="#Footnote-461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 461.">[461]</a></p>

<p>It is curious that most modern writers assume the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>English cloth trade to have practically started with
the introduction of Flemish weavers by Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>
It is constantly asserted<a name="Anchor-462" id="Anchor-462"></a><a href="#Footnote-462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 462.">[462]</a> that prior to this the cloth
made in England was of a very poor quality and
entirely for home consumption. Both statements
are incorrect. A very large proportion of the native
cloth was certainly coarse 'burel,' such as that of
which 2000 ells were bought at Winchester in 1172
for the soldiers in Ireland,<a name="Anchor-463" id="Anchor-463"></a><a href="#Footnote-463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 463.">[463]</a> or the still coarser and
cheaper Cornish burels which were distributed to
the poor by the royal almoner about this time.<a name="Anchor-464" id="Anchor-464"></a><a href="#Footnote-464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 464.">[464]</a>
At the other end of the scale were the scarlet cloths
for which Lincoln and Stamford early attained
fame. Scarlet cloth, dyed if not actually made on
the spot, was bought in Lincoln for the king in 1182
at the prodigious price of 6s. 8d. the ell, about £7
in modern money. At the same time 'blanket'
cloth and green say cost 3s. the ell, and grey say
1s. 8d.<a name="Anchor-465" id="Anchor-465"></a><a href="#Footnote-465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 465.">[465]</a> Thirty years later the importance of the
trade is indicated by the inclusion in Magna Carta of
a section fixing the breadth of 'dyed cloths, russets,
and halbergetts' at two ells 'within the lists.'<a name="Anchor-466" id="Anchor-466"></a><a href="#Footnote-466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 466.">[466]</a>
Infringements of the 'assize of cloth' were of constant
occurrence, and were amongst the matters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>inquired into by the justices holding 'pleas of the
Crown'; for instance, in Kent, in 1226, some thirty
merchants and clothiers are presented as offenders
in this respect,<a name="Anchor-467" id="Anchor-467"></a><a href="#Footnote-467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 467.">[467]</a> Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> at the beginning of his
reign, in May 1218, had ordered that any cloths of
less than two ells breadth exposed for sale should be
forfeited,<a name="Anchor-468" id="Anchor-468"></a><a href="#Footnote-468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 468.">[468]</a> but this order was not to take effect
before Christmas so far as burels made by the men
of London, Marlborough, and Bedwin (Wilts.) were
concerned, and in 1225 the citizens of London were
exempted from keeping the assize, provided their
burels were not made narrower than they used to
be.<a name="Anchor-469" id="Anchor-469"></a><a href="#Footnote-469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 469.">[469]</a> In 1246 the sheriff of London was ordered to
buy one thousand ells of cheap burel to give to the
poor;<a name="Anchor-470" id="Anchor-470"></a><a href="#Footnote-470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 470.">[470]</a> and in 1250 we find the king discharging an
outstanding bill of £155 due to a number of London
burellers, whose names are recorded;<a name="Anchor-471" id="Anchor-471"></a><a href="#Footnote-471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 471.">[471]</a> amongst
them was one Gerard le Flemeng, but otherwise they
appear to have been native workmen. The burellers
seem to have already separated off from the weavers,
and had certainly done so some time before 1300, at
which date disputes between the two classes of
clothmakers were common.<a name="Anchor-472" id="Anchor-472"></a><a href="#Footnote-472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 472.">[472]</a></p>

<p>Apart from the burels, which were probably
very similar wherever made, the cloths made at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>different centres usually possessed distinctive characteristics.
In the list of customs paid at Venice
on imported goods in 1265,<a name="Anchor-473" id="Anchor-473"></a><a href="#Footnote-473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 473.">[473]</a> we find mention of
'English Stamfords,' 'dyed Stamfords,' and of
'Milanese Stamfords of Monza,' showing that this
particular class of English cloth was sufficiently
good to be copied abroad. It is rather a noticeable
feature of the cloth trade that so many of the trade
terms were taken from the names of the places in
which the particular wares originated. A prominent
instance of this occurs in the case of 'chalons,' which
derived their name from Chalons-sur-Marne, but
were made in England from an early date. 'Chalons
of Guildford' were bought for the king's use at
Winchester Fair in 1252.<a name="Anchor-474" id="Anchor-474"></a><a href="#Footnote-474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 474.">[474]</a> Winchester itself was
an early centre of the manufacture of chalons, which
were rugs used for coverlets or counterpanes, and in
the consuetudinary of the city,<a name="Anchor-475" id="Anchor-475"></a><a href="#Footnote-475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 475.">[475]</a> which dates back
at least to the early years of the thirteenth century,
the looms are divided into two classes, the 'great
looms' used for burel weaving paying 5s. a year,
and the 'little looms' for chalons paying 6d. or 12d.,
according to their size. The chalons were to be of
fixed dimensions, those 4 ells long being 2 yards in
breadth (<i>devant li tapener</i>), those of 3½ yards 1¾ yards
wide, and those of 3 ells long 1½ ells wide. Coverlets
formed also an important branch of the Norfolk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>worsted<a name="Anchor-476" id="Anchor-476"></a><a href="#Footnote-476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 476.">[476]</a> industry; in this case the ancient measurements
were said in 1327 to have been 6 ells by 5,
5 by 4, or 4 by 3.<a name="Anchor-477" id="Anchor-477"></a><a href="#Footnote-477" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 477.">[477]</a> At a later date, in 1442,
we find worsted 'beddes' of much greater dimensions,
the three 'assizes' being 14 yards by 4, 12 by
3, or 10 by 2½,<a name="Anchor-478" id="Anchor-478"></a><a href="#Footnote-478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 478.">[478]</a> but presumably these were complete
sets of coverlet, tester and curtains, such as those of
which a number are valued at from 6s. 8d. to 20s.
a piece in the inventory of the goods of the late King
Henry <abbr title="the fifth"><span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span></abbr> in 1423.<a name="Anchor-479" id="Anchor-479"></a><a href="#Footnote-479" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 479.">[479]</a> Besides bedclothes the worsted
weavers made piece cloth, and amongst the exports
from Boston in 1302 figure worsted cloths and
worsted seys.<a name="Anchor-480" id="Anchor-480"></a><a href="#Footnote-480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 480.">[480]</a> Boston, as we might expect from its
nearness to Lincoln, exported a good deal of scarlet
cloth, while the amount of 'English cloth' sent out
is proof of a demand for this material abroad: a
ship from Lubeck took 'English cloth' worth £250
for one merchant, Tideman de Lippe, and two other
ships carried cargoes of the same material worth
more than £200. 'Beverley cloths' are also represented
amongst these exports, and coloured cloths
of Lincoln and Beverley are found about this time
at Ipswich paying the same tolls as foreign cloths.<a name="Anchor-481" id="Anchor-481"></a><a href="#Footnote-481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 481.">[481]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>At Ipswich also cloths of Cogsall, Maldon, Colchester,
and Sudbury are mentioned as typical 'clothes of
Ynglond' exported<a name="Anchor-482" id="Anchor-482"></a><a href="#Footnote-482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 482.">[482]</a> and are classified as 'of
doubele warke that men clepeth tomannyshete,'
and a smaller kind 'of longe webbe that they call
omannesete,'<a name="Anchor-483" id="Anchor-483"></a><a href="#Footnote-483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 483.">[483]</a> or 'oon mannys hete.' The origin
of these terms appears to be unknown, but as these
were probably the narrow cloths afterwards known
as 'Essex straits,' there was possibly some connection
with the narrow 'Osetes' of Bristol.<a name="Anchor-484" id="Anchor-484"></a><a href="#Footnote-484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 484.">[484]</a></p>

<p>So far as London is concerned, the skill of the
weavers at the end of the thirteenth century is
shown by the variety of types of cloth which are
referred to in the regulations of 1300.<a name="Anchor-485" id="Anchor-485"></a><a href="#Footnote-485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 485.">[485]</a> Here we
find mention of cloths called andly, porreye, menuet,
virli, lumbard, marbled ground with vetch-blossom,
hawes, bissets, etc. But it would seem that the
English cloth makers failed to keep pace<a name="Anchor-486" id="Anchor-486"></a><a href="#Footnote-486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 486.">[486]</a> with their
Continental rivals, and instead of improving the
quality of their goods endeavoured to keep up
prices by restricting their output.<a name="Anchor-487" id="Anchor-487"></a><a href="#Footnote-487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 487.">[487]</a> Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>,
seeing the need for new blood, took measures to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>attract foreign clothworkers<a name="Anchor-488" id="Anchor-488"></a><a href="#Footnote-488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 488.">[488]</a> to England, and at
the same time, in 1337, absolutely prohibited the
use or importation of foreign cloth.<a name="Anchor-489" id="Anchor-489"></a><a href="#Footnote-489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 489.">[489]</a> In order to
stimulate the output he even withdrew all restrictions
as to measures, and licensed the making of
cloths of any length and breadth; but this excess
of freedom soon proved unworkable. The newcomers
were not very popular with the native
weavers, and in 1340 the king had to send orders
to the Mayor of Bristol to cease from interfering
with Thomas Blanket and others who had set up
machines for making cloth, and had brought over
workmen.<a name="Anchor-490" id="Anchor-490"></a><a href="#Footnote-490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 490.">[490]</a> The vexation against which Blanket
had appealed seems to have been the regulation that
every new weaving loom was to pay 5s. 1d. to the
Mayor, and 40d. to the aldermen; this rule was
confirmed in 1346, but annulled in 1355.<a name="Anchor-491" id="Anchor-491"></a><a href="#Footnote-491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 491.">[491]</a></p>

<p>Before dealing with the various ordinances by which
the manufacture of cloth was controlled, it may be
as well to consider the processes through which the
wool passed before it reached the market, for</p>

<p>The first process, then, was the sorting of the wool.
The better quality was used for the ordinary cloths,
and the worst was made up into coarse cloth known
as cogware and Kendal cloth, three-quarters of a yard
broad, and worth from 40d. to 5s. the piece.<a name="Anchor-497" id="Anchor-497"></a><a href="#Footnote-497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 497.">[497]</a> The term
cogware seems to have sprung from its being sold
to cogmen, the crews of the ships called cogs; but
whether for their own use, or for export is not quite
clear. The alternative name of Kendal cloths was
derived from the district of Kendal in Westmoreland,
a seat of the industry, at least as early as 1256.<a name="Anchor-498" id="Anchor-498"></a><a href="#Footnote-498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 498.">[498]</a>
The mixing of different qualities of wool in one
cloth was prohibited; and as it was forbidden to mix
English wool with Spanish,<a name="Anchor-499" id="Anchor-499"></a><a href="#Footnote-499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 499.">[499]</a> so was the use of flocks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>or refuse wool, in ordinary cloth,<a name="Anchor-500" id="Anchor-500"></a><a href="#Footnote-500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 500.">[500]</a> except in the case
of the cloth of Devonshire, in which, owing to the
coarseness of the wool, an admixture of flock was
necessary.<a name="Anchor-501" id="Anchor-501"></a><a href="#Footnote-501" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 501.">[501]</a></p>

<p>In dyeing two mediums are required, the colouring
matter and the mordant which fixes the dye in the
wool. The mordant most in use in the Middle Ages
was alum,<a name="Anchor-502" id="Anchor-502"></a><a href="#Footnote-502" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 502.">[502]</a> and at Bristol in 1346 we find that only
'Spyralym, Glasalym, and Bokkan' might be used
and that any one using 'Bitterwos' or 'Alym de
Wyght,' which must have derived its name from the
Isle of Wight, or even found with any in his possession,
was liable to be fined.<a name="Anchor-503" id="Anchor-503"></a><a href="#Footnote-503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 503.">[503]</a> Far the commonest
dye-stuff was the blue woad, of which enormous
quantities were used. The plant (<i>Isatis tinctoria</i>)
from which this was prepared is indigenous (the
ancient Britons, indeed, wore the dye without the
intervention of cloth), but practically all the woad
used commercially in England was imported, Southampton
being one of the great centres of the trade.<a name="Anchor-504" id="Anchor-504"></a><a href="#Footnote-504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 504.">[504]</a>
In 1286 the authorities at Norwich came to an
agreement with the woad merchants of Amiens and
Corby as to the size of the packages in which woad
and weld, a yellow dye in much demand, might be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>sold,<a name="Anchor-505" id="Anchor-505"></a><a href="#Footnote-505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 505.">[505]</a> and at Bristol some sixty years later elaborate
regulations were drawn up for the preparation of the
woad, of which two varieties are mentioned, that
of Picardy and that of Toulouse.<a name="Anchor-506" id="Anchor-506"></a><a href="#Footnote-506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 506.">[506]</a> The woad was
imported in casks in the form of dry balls; these
had to be broken up small, moistened with water,
and then heaped up to ferment; after a few days
the top layer became so hot that it could hardly be
touched with the hand; the heap was then turned
over to bring the bottom to the top, and left till this
in turn had fermented; a third turn usually sufficed
to complete the process.<a name="Anchor-507" id="Anchor-507"></a><a href="#Footnote-507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 507.">[507]</a> In Bristol special 'porters'
were appointed to undertake and supervise this
seasoning and the subsequent storing of the woad,
and a further regulation compelled the merchant to
sell his woad within forty days after it had been
stored and assayed.<a name="Anchor-508" id="Anchor-508"></a><a href="#Footnote-508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 508.">[508]</a> The setting of the woad, that
is to say its conversion into dye, was also an art
in itself, and it would seem that in Bristol it was the
custom for dyers to go to the houses of their customers
and prepare the woad-vats. Through undertaking
more jobs than they could properly attend to, much
woad was spoilt, and in 1360 they were forbidden
to take charge of more than one lot of dye at one
time.<a name="Anchor-509" id="Anchor-509"></a><a href="#Footnote-509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 509.">[509]</a> Further abuses arose through the ignorance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>and incapacity of many of the itinerant dyers, and
in 1407 it was enacted that only those dyers who held
a certificate of competency should ply their trade
in the town.<a name="Anchor-510" id="Anchor-510"></a><a href="#Footnote-510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 510.">[510]</a> At Coventry, another great centre
of the trade, complaints were made in 1415 that the
dyers had not only raised their prices, charging
6s. 8d. instead of 5s. for a cloth, 30s. instead of 20s.
for 60 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of wool, and 6s. instead of 4s. for 12 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr>
of the thread for which the town was famous, but
were in the habit of taking the best part (<i>la floure</i>)
of the woad and madder for their own cloths, and
using only the weaker portion for their customers'
cloths. A petition was therefore made that two
drapers, a woader and a dyer, should be elected
annually to supervise the trade.<a name="Anchor-511" id="Anchor-511"></a><a href="#Footnote-511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 511.">[511]</a> Some fifty years
later we have at Coventry a notice of what appears
to have been a medieval instance of a quarrel between
a 'trade union,' the Dyers Company, and 'blackleg'
firms.<a name="Anchor-512" id="Anchor-512"></a><a href="#Footnote-512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 512.">[512]</a> Thomas de Fenby and ten other dyers of
Coventry complained against John Egynton and
William Warde that they had assembled the members
of their trade and had compelled them to swear
to various things contrary to the law and their
conscience, as that no one should buy any woad
until it had been viewed and appraised by six men
chosen for the purpose by the said Egynton and
Warde, and that no dyer should make any scarlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>dye (<i>grene</i>) at less than 6s. (the vat?), or put any
cloth into woad for less than 4d. or 5d. Warde and
Egynton had also adopted the medieval form of
picketing, by hiring Welshmen and Irishmen to
waylay and kill the complainants on their way to
neighbouring markets.</p>

<p>A list of cloths made in York in 1395-6<a name="Anchor-513" id="Anchor-513"></a><a href="#Footnote-513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 513.">[513]</a> gives some
idea of the colours in general use. For the first
three months, September-December, blue largely
predominated, but for some unexplained reason
this colour almost disappeared from January to
May, its place being taken by russet. Red, sanguine,
morrey (or orange), plunket,<a name="Anchor-514" id="Anchor-514"></a><a href="#Footnote-514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 514.">[514]</a> green, and motleys,
white, blue, and green occur; also 'paly,' which
was presumably some striped material, and in a
very few cases black. By the regulations drawn up
in London in 1298,<a name="Anchor-515" id="Anchor-515"></a><a href="#Footnote-515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 515.">[515]</a> no dyer who dyed burnets blue<a name="Anchor-516" id="Anchor-516"></a><a href="#Footnote-516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 516.">[516]</a>
or other colours might dye 'blecche' or tawny:
the reason does not appear, but this uncertain tint,
'blecche,' occurs again as reserved specially for
Spanish wool.<a name="Anchor-517" id="Anchor-517"></a><a href="#Footnote-517" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 517.">[517]</a> For blue, as we have seen, woad
was used, and for yellow weld, a combination of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>two yielding green; scarlet was derived from the
grain (<i>greyne</i>),<a name="Anchor-518" id="Anchor-518"></a><a href="#Footnote-518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 518.">[518]</a> and reds and russets from madder,
which was imported in large quantities. Several
varieties of lichen were probably included under the
head of 'orchal,' and afforded shades of brown and
red. Fancy shades were formed by double dyeing,
and apparently were not always reliable, as a statute<a name="Anchor-519" id="Anchor-519"></a><a href="#Footnote-519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 519.">[519]</a>
passed in 1533 ordered that none should dye woollen
cloth 'as browne blewes, pewkes, tawnyes, or vyolettes,'
unless they were 'perfectly boyled, greyned,
or madered upon the wode, and shotte with good
and sufficient corke or orchall.' At this time
brazil, or logwood, was being adopted as a dye,
and its use was absolutely forbidden.</p>

<p>Carding, or combing, and spinning are processes
which need not detain us long. They were both
home industries, and spinning, in particular, was the
staple employment of the women, and accordingly
regulations were not infrequently made to ensure a
good supply of wool for their use. At Bristol, in
1346, no oiled wool ready for carding and spinning
might be sent out of the town until the carders and
spinners had had a chance of applying for it; moreover,
it might only be exposed for sale on a Friday,
and no middleman might buy it.<a name="Anchor-520" id="Anchor-520"></a><a href="#Footnote-520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 520.">[520]</a> Similarly at
Norwich, in 1532, the butchers were ordered to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>bring their woolfells into the market and offer them
for sale to the poor women who lived by spinning.<a name="Anchor-521" id="Anchor-521"></a><a href="#Footnote-521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 521.">[521]</a>
When the clothmaking trade got into the hands of
the big capitalist clothiers, who gave out their wool
to be carded and spun, it became necessary to pass
laws<a name="Anchor-522" id="Anchor-522"></a><a href="#Footnote-522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 522.">[522]</a> to ensure on the one hand that the workers
should do their work faithfully, and not abstract
any of the wool,<a name="Anchor-523" id="Anchor-523"></a><a href="#Footnote-523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 523.">[523]</a> and on the other, that the masters
should not defraud the carders and spinners by
paying them in food or goods<a name="Anchor-524" id="Anchor-524"></a><a href="#Footnote-524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 524.">[524]</a> instead of in money,
or by the use of false weights, making women, for
instance, comb 7½ <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr> of wool as a 'combing stone,'
which should only contain 5 <abbr title="pounds">lbs.</abbr><a name="Anchor-525" id="Anchor-525"></a><a href="#Footnote-525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 525.">[525]</a></p>

<p>Weaving was, of course, the most important of
all the processes in clothmaking. Reduced to its
simplest form, the weaver's loom consists of a
horizontal frame, to the ends of which the warp
threads, which run longitudinally through the cloth,
are fastened in such manner that they can be raised
and depressed by heddles, or looped threads, in
alternate series, leaving room between the two
layers of warp for the passage of the shuttle, charged
with the woof.<a name="Anchor-526" id="Anchor-526"></a><a href="#Footnote-526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 526.">[526]</a> The shuttle, flying from side to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>side across the alternating warp threads, covers
them with woof, which is packed close by a vertical
frame of rods, the lay or batten, swinging between
the warp threads. To weave tight and close required
considerable strength, and at Norwich women were
forbidden to weave worsteds because they were 'not
of sufficient power' to work them properly.<a name="Anchor-527" id="Anchor-527"></a><a href="#Footnote-527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 527.">[527]</a> The
cloth as it was woven was wound on a roll, bringing
a fresh portion of the warp within the weaver's
reach, but while its length was thus limited merely
by custom or convenience, its breadth was obviously
controlled by the width of the loom, and when
Henry <abbr title="the fourth"><span class="smcap lowercase">IV.</span></abbr>, in 1406, ordered that cloth of ray should
be made six-quarters of a yard broad instead of
five-quarters, as had always been the custom, the
order had to be revoked as it would have necessitated
all the ray weavers obtaining new looms.<a name="Anchor-528" id="Anchor-528"></a><a href="#Footnote-528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 528.">[528]</a>
For the right to use looms payments had often to
be made to authorities of the town. At Winchester
in the thirteenth century, every burel loom paid 5s.
yearly, the only exceptions being that the mayor,
the hospital, and the town clerk might each work
one loom free of charge.<a name="Anchor-529" id="Anchor-529"></a><a href="#Footnote-529" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 529.">[529]</a> Nottingham was another
town where duties were paid on looms,<a name="Anchor-530" id="Anchor-530"></a><a href="#Footnote-530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 530.">[530]</a> and at
Bristol, as we have seen, prior to 1355, the erection
of a 'webanlam' entailed payments of 8s. 5d. in all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>To guard against false working, it was the rule at
Bristol that all looms must stand in shops and rooms
adjoining the road, and in sight of the people, and
the erection of a loom in a cellar or upstair room
entailed a fine.<a name="Anchor-531" id="Anchor-531"></a><a href="#Footnote-531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 531.">[531]</a> It was possibly for the same reason
that weavers were forbidden to work at night,<a name="Anchor-532" id="Anchor-532"></a><a href="#Footnote-532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 532.">[532]</a>
though an exception was made at Winchester in
favour of the period immediately preceding Christmas.<a name="Anchor-533" id="Anchor-533"></a><a href="#Footnote-533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 533.">[533]</a>
On the other hand, the London jurors in
1320 coupled this ordinance against working by
candle light with the enforced holiday which the
weavers' gild compelled its members to take between
Christmas and the Purification (2nd February)<a name="Anchor-534" id="Anchor-534"></a><a href="#Footnote-534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 534.">[534]</a> as
measures prejudicial to the commonalty, and intended
to restrict the supply and so maintain the
price of cloth.<a name="Anchor-535" id="Anchor-535"></a><a href="#Footnote-535" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 535.">[535]</a> A further device for the same
purpose was the rule that no cloth of Candlewick
Street was to be worked in less than four days,
though they might easily be made in two or three
days.<a name="Anchor-536" id="Anchor-536"></a><a href="#Footnote-536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 536.">[536]</a> Thanks to these methods, and to the way
in which admission to the gild was limited, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>looms in the city had been reduced in thirty years
or so from 380 to 80, and the price of cloth had
risen accordingly. The authorities throughout the
country were constantly in the dilemma of having
on the one hand to permit the restriction of the
numbers of the weavers, with a consequent rise in
the cost of their wares, or, on the other hand, running
the risk of inferior workmanship 'to the grete infamie
and disclaundre of their worshipfull towne.'
Not only were the unauthorised weavers often
ignorant of their art, not having served their
apprenticeship, but they used flock and other bad
material, and bought stolen wool and 'thrummes.'<a name="Anchor-537" id="Anchor-537"></a><a href="#Footnote-537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 537.">[537]</a>
The latter were the unwoven warp threads left over
at the end of the cloth, and as there was no export
duty on thrums, the weavers contrived to cut them
off as long as possible, and in this way much woollen
yarn was sent out of the country without paying
customs, until the practice was made illegal by an
Act of Parliament in 1430.<a name="Anchor-538" id="Anchor-538"></a><a href="#Footnote-538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 538.">[538]</a></p>

<p>The cloth on leaving the loom was in the condition
known as 'raw,' and although not yet ready for use
was marketable, and many of the smaller clothmakers
preferred to dispose of their products at
this stage rather than incur the expense of the
further processes. This seems to have been the
case on the Welsh border, as Shrewsbury claimed to
have had a market for '<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pannus crudus</i>' from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>time of King John.<a name="Anchor-539" id="Anchor-539"></a><a href="#Footnote-539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 539.">[539]</a> Much raw cloth was also
bought up by foreign merchants and sent out of
the country to be finished; and at the beginning of
the sixteenth century Parliament, with its usual
terror of foreign trade, seeing only that the finishing
processes would be carried out by foreign workmen
instead of English, forbade the export of unfinished
cloth. It had then to be pointed out that, as most
of these cloths were bought to be dyed abroad, and
as after dyeing all the finishing processes would
have to be repeated, the cost of the cheaper varieties
would be so raised that there would be no sale for
them; cloths below the value of five marks were
therefore exempted.<a name="Anchor-540" id="Anchor-540"></a><a href="#Footnote-540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 540.">[540]</a></p>

<p>Raw cloth had next to be fulled, that is to say,
scoured, cleansed, and thickened by beating it in
water. Originally this was always done by men
trampling upon it in a trough, and the process was
known as 'walking,' the fuller being called a 'walker'
(whence the common surname), but during the thirteenth
century an instrument came into general use
called 'the stocks,' consisting of an upright, to
which was hinged the 'perch' or wooden bar with
which the cloth was beaten. The perch was often
worked by water power and fulling, or walking,
mills soon became common. By the regulations
of the fullers' gild of Lincoln recorded in 1389,<a name="Anchor-541" id="Anchor-541"></a><a href="#Footnote-541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 541.">[541]</a> no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>fuller was to 'work in the trough,' that is to say to
walk the cloth, and a further rule forbade any man
to work at the perch with a woman, unless she were
the wife of a master or her handmaid. Probably
the intention of this last rule was to put a stop to
the employment of cheap female labour 'by the
whiche many ... likkely men to do the Kyng
servis in his warris and in the defence of this his
lond, and sufficiently lorned in the seid crafte, gothe
vagaraunt and unoccupied and may not have thar
labour to ther levyng.'<a name="Anchor-542" id="Anchor-542"></a><a href="#Footnote-542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 542.">[542]</a> About 1297 a number of
London fullers took to sending cloths to be fulled
at certain mills in Stratford, and as this was found
to result in much loss to the owners of the cloths,
orders were given to stop all cloths on their way to
the mills, and only allow them to be sent on at the
express desire of the owners.<a name="Anchor-543" id="Anchor-543"></a><a href="#Footnote-543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 543.">[543]</a> This seems to point
to mill fulling being inferior to manual labour, while
possibly the fulling being conducted outside the
control of the city may have tended to bad work.
At Bristol in 1346, one of the rules for the fullers
forbids any one to send 'rauclothe' to the mill, and
afterwards receive it back to be finished,<a name="Anchor-544" id="Anchor-544"></a><a href="#Footnote-544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 544.">[544]</a> and in 1406
the town fullers were forbidden to make good the
defects in cloths fulled by country workmen.<a name="Anchor-545" id="Anchor-545"></a><a href="#Footnote-545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 545.">[545]</a></p>

<p>For cleansing the cloth use was made of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>peculiar absorbent earth known as Fuller's earth, or
'walkerherth,'<a name="Anchor-546" id="Anchor-546"></a><a href="#Footnote-546" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 546.">[546]</a> as it was sometimes called. Fuller's
earth is only found in a few places, the largest deposits
being round Nutfield and Reigate,<a name="Anchor-547" id="Anchor-547"></a><a href="#Footnote-547" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 547.">[547]</a> and on
account of its rarity and importance its export was
forbidden.</p>

<p>The cloth, having been fulled, had to be stretched
on tenters to dry, and references to the lease of
tenter grounds are common in medieval town
records.<a name="Anchor-548" id="Anchor-548"></a><a href="#Footnote-548" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 548.">[548]</a> A certain amount of stretching was
legitimate and even necessary,<a name="Anchor-549" id="Anchor-549"></a><a href="#Footnote-549" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 549.">[549]</a> but where the cloth
belonged to the fuller, and it was a common practice
for fullers to buy the raw cloth, there was a temptation
to 'stretch him out with ropes and rack him
till the sinews stretch again'<a name="Anchor-550" id="Anchor-550"></a><a href="#Footnote-550" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 550.">[550]</a> so as to gain several
yards. As a result of this practice, which greatly
impaired the strength of the cloth, 'Guildford cloths,'
made in Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, lost their
reputation, and in 1391 measures had to be taken to
restore their good name by forbidding fullers, or
other persons, to buy the cloth in an unfinished
state.<a name="Anchor-551" id="Anchor-551"></a><a href="#Footnote-551" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 551.">[551]</a> Several other Acts were passed dealing with
this offence, and during the sixteenth century
ordinances were issued against the use of powerful
racks with levers, winches, and ropes. Infringements
of these Acts were numerous,<a name="Anchor-552" id="Anchor-552"></a><a href="#Footnote-552" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 552.">[552]</a> and as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>example of the extent to which cloths were stretched
we may quote a return from Reading in 1597, which
mentions one cloth of thirty yards stretched with 'a
gyn and a leaver with a vice and a roape' to thirty-five
yards, and another stretched with a rope 'to the
quantitye of three barrs length—every barr contayneth
about 2½ yards.'<a name="Anchor-553" id="Anchor-553"></a><a href="#Footnote-553" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 553.">[553]</a></p>

<p>On leaving the fuller the cloth passed into the
hands of the rower, whose business it was to draw
up from the body of the cloth all the loose fibres
with teazles. Teazles, the dried heads of the
'fuller's thistle,' are mentioned amongst the goods
of some of the Colchester cloth-workers in 1301,<a name="Anchor-554" id="Anchor-554"></a><a href="#Footnote-554" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 554.">[554]</a>
were used from the earliest times, and have never
been supplanted even in these days of machinery.
Several unsuccessful attempts have been made
to invent substitutes, and in 1474 the use of iron
cards, or combs, instead of teazles, had to be forbidden.<a name="Anchor-555" id="Anchor-555"></a><a href="#Footnote-555" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 555.">[555]</a>
The loose portions of the cloth thus raised
by the teazles were next cut off by the shearman,
upon whose dexterity the cloth depended for the
finish of its surface, and, after the drawer had
skilfully repaired any small blemishes, the cloth
was ready for sale.</p>

<p>In view of the multiplicity of processes involved,
it is obvious that the manufacture of cloth must
have afforded employment to an immense number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>persons. An account written in Suffolk just over
the borders of our medieval period, in 1618, reckons
that the clothier who made twenty broad cloths in
a week would employ in one way and another five
hundred persons.<a name="Anchor-556" id="Anchor-556"></a><a href="#Footnote-556" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 556.">[556]</a> But even at that time, when the
capitalist clothier was firmly established, there were
not very many with so large an output as twenty
cloths a week, and in earlier times there were very
few approaching such a total. The ulnager's
accounts<a name="Anchor-557" id="Anchor-557"></a><a href="#Footnote-557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 557.">[557]</a> of the duties paid on cloths exist for most
counties for the last few years of Richard <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>, and
throw considerable light on the state of the trade.
In the case of Suffolk for the year 1395, we have
733 broad cloths made by about one hundred and
twenty persons, of whom only seven or eight return
as many as twenty cloths; the chief output, however,
was narrow cloth, made in dozens (pieces of
12 yards, a 'whole cloth' being 24 yards); of these
300 makers turned out about 9200, fifteen of their
number making from 120 to 160 dozens each. In
the case of Essex there is more evidence for the
capitalist clothier, as at Coggeshall the 1200 narrow
cloths are assigned to only nine makers (the largest
items being 400, 250, and 200 dozens), while Braintree,
with 2400 dozens had only eight makers, of
whom two pay subsidy on 600 dozens each and one
on 480. The great clothiers, however, at this time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>are found in the west, at Barnstaple, where John
Parman paid on 1080 dozen, and Richard Burnard
on 1005, other nine clothiers dividing some 1600
dozens between them. For the rest of Devonshire,
sixty-five makers account for 3565 dozens, or rather
over fifty a piece. If Devon stood at one end of the
scale its next-door neighbour was at the other, for
Cornwall's total output was only ninety cloths,
attributed to thirteen makers. At Salisbury the
year's output of 6600 whole cloths was divided
between 158 persons, only seven of whom accounted
for more than 150 each, while at Winchester, where
over 3000 cloths are returned, only three clothiers
exceeded the hundred, and men of such local prominence
as Robert Hall and 'Markays le Fayre'<a name="Anchor-558" id="Anchor-558"></a><a href="#Footnote-558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 558.">[558]</a> had
only eighty and forty to their respective accounts.
Throughout Yorkshire the average does not seem to
have been above ten cloths, and in Kent, a stronghold
of the broad cloth manufacture, only one clothier
exceeded fifty dozens, and only three others passed
twenty-five. The whole evidence seems to limit
the spheres of influence of the capitalist clothiers to
a few definite towns prior to the beginning of the
fifteenth century. But the latter half of the fifteenth
century saw the rise of the great clothiers such as
John Winchcombe,<a name="Anchor-559" id="Anchor-559"></a><a href="#Footnote-559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 559.">[559]</a> the famous 'Jack of Newbury,'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>and the Springs of Lavenham,<a name="Anchor-560" id="Anchor-560"></a><a href="#Footnote-560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 560.">[560]</a> employers of labour
on a scale which soon swamped the small independent
clothworkers, and drew them into a position
of dependence.</p>

<p>Skill and industry in the cloth trade had always
been assured of a good return, and when combined
with enterprise had often led to wealth; but there
have always in all times and all places been men
who would try the short cut to fortune through
fraud; and the openings for fraud in the cloth
trade were particularly numerous. 'Certayne
townes in England ... were wonte to make
theyre clothes of certayne bredth and length and to
sette theyre seales to the same; while they kept
the rate trulye strangers dyd but looke over the
seale and receyve theyre wares, wherebye these
townes had greate vente of theyre clothes and consequently
prospered verye welle. Afterwards some
in those townes, not content with reasonable gaynes
but contynually desyrynge more, devysed clothes
of lesse length, bredthe and goodnes thanne they
were wonte to be, and yet by the comendacioun of
the seale to have as myche monye for the same as
they had before for good clothes. And for a tyme
they gate myche and so abused the credythe of theyr
predecessours to theyre singulere lukere, whiche
was recompensede with the losse of theyre posterytye.
For these clothes were founde fawltye for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>alle theyre seale, they were not onelye never the
better trustede but myche lesse for theyre seale,
yea although theyre clothes were well made. For
whanne theyr untruth and falshede was espyede
than no manne wolde buye theyre clothes untylle
they were enforsede and unfoldede, regardynge
nothynge the seale.'<a name="Anchor-561" id="Anchor-561"></a><a href="#Footnote-561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 561.">[561]</a></p>

<p>This complaint, written in the time of Henry <abbr title="the eighth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span></abbr>,
is borne out in every detail by the records of Parliament
and of municipalities. Regulations were
constantly laid down for ensuring uniformity, and
officials called ulnagers<a name="Anchor-562" id="Anchor-562"></a><a href="#Footnote-562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 562.">[562]</a> were appointed to see that
they were obeyed, no cloth being allowed to be
sold unless it bore the ulnager's seal. The assize
of cloth issued in 1328<a name="Anchor-563" id="Anchor-563"></a><a href="#Footnote-563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 563.">[563]</a> fixed the measurements of
cloth of ray at 28 yards by 6 quarters, and those of
coloured cloths at 26 yards by 6½ quarters, in the
raw state, each being 24 yards when shrunk. The
penalty for infringement of the assize was forfeiture.<a name="Anchor-564" id="Anchor-564"></a><a href="#Footnote-564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 564.">[564]</a>
This assize, which was confirmed in 1406, repealed
next year, but reaffirmed in 1410,<a name="Anchor-565" id="Anchor-565"></a><a href="#Footnote-565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 565.">[565]</a> applied only to
broad cloths, but in 1432 it was laid down<a name="Anchor-566" id="Anchor-566"></a><a href="#Footnote-566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 566.">[566]</a> that
narrow cloths called 'streits' should be 12 yards by
1 yard, when shrunk; if smaller they were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>forfeited, but the ulnager cut the list off one end,
to show that it was not a whole cloth, and it was sold
as a 'remnant' according to its actual measure.
In the case of the worsteds or serges of Norfolk,
four different assizes were said in 1327 to have been
used from time immemorial, namely, 50, 40, 30, and
24 ells in length;<a name="Anchor-567" id="Anchor-567"></a><a href="#Footnote-567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 567.">[567]</a> but as early as 1315 merchants
complained that the cloths of Worsted and Aylesham
did not keep their assize, 20 ells being sold as 24,
25 ells as 30, and so on.<a name="Anchor-568" id="Anchor-568"></a><a href="#Footnote-568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 568.">[568]</a> In the western counties,
Somerset, Gloucester, and Dorset, fraudulent makers
were in the habit of so tacking and folding their
cloths that defects in length or quality could not be
seen, with the result that merchants who bought
them in good faith and took them to foreign countries
were beaten, imprisoned and even slain by their
angry customers 'to the great dishonour of the
realm.' It was therefore ordered in 1390 that no
cloth should be sold, tacked, and folded, but open.<a name="Anchor-569" id="Anchor-569"></a><a href="#Footnote-569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 569.">[569]</a>
The frauds in connection with stretching Guildford
cloths have already been referred to, and in 1410
we find that worsteds which had formerly been in
great demand abroad were now so deceitfully made
that the Flemish merchants were talking of searching,
or examining, all the worsted cloths at the ports
of entry. To remedy this 'great slander of the
country,' the mayor and his deputies were given the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>power to search and seal all worsteds brought to
the worsted seld, or cloth market, and regulations
were made as to the size of 'thretty elnys streites'
(30 ells by 2 quarters), 'thretty elnys brodes'
(30 ells by 3 quarters), 'mantelles, sengles, doubles
et demy doubles, si bien les motles, paules, chekeres,
raies, flores, pleynes, monkes-clothes et autres
mantelles' (from 6 to 10 ells by 1¼ ell), and 'chanon-clothes,
sengles, demy doubles et doubles' (5 ells by
1¾), the variety of trade terms showing the extent
of the industry.<a name="Anchor-570" id="Anchor-570"></a><a href="#Footnote-570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 570.">[570]</a> A similar complaint of the decay
in the foreign demand for worsteds owing to the
malpractices of the makers was met in 1442 by
causing the worsted weavers of Norwich to elect
annually four wardens for the city, and two for the
county to oversee the trade.<a name="Anchor-571" id="Anchor-571"></a><a href="#Footnote-571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 571.">[571]</a> Half a century later,
in 1473, English cloth in general had fallen into
disrepute abroad, and even at home, much foreign
cloth being imported: to remedy this general orders
were issued for the proper working of cloth, the maintenance
of the old assize, and the indication of defects,
a seal being attached to the lower edge of any cloth
where there was any 'raw, skaw, cokel or fagge.'<a name="Anchor-572" id="Anchor-572"></a><a href="#Footnote-572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 572.">[572]</a></p>

<p>The last-mentioned statutes of 1473 give the
measurements of the cloths as by the 'yard and
inch.' Originally it would seem to have been
customary when measuring cloth to mark the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>of each yard by placing the thumb on the cloth at
the end of the clothyard, and starting again on the
other side of the thumb. Readers of George Eliot
will remember that the pedlar, Bob Salt, made
ingenious use of his broad thumb in measuring, to
the detriment of his customers; and the London
drapers in the fifteenth century claimed to buy by
the 'yard and a hand,' marking the yards with the
hand instead of with the thumb, and thereby
scoring two yards in every twenty-four.<a name="Anchor-573" id="Anchor-573"></a><a href="#Footnote-573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 573.">[573]</a> Although
this was forbidden in 1440, the use being ordered
of a measuring line of silk, 12 yards and 12 inches
long, the end of each yard being marked an inch, it
evidently continued in practice, as the 'yarde and
handfull' was known as London measure at the end
of the sixteenth century.<a name="Anchor-574" id="Anchor-574"></a><a href="#Footnote-574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 574.">[574]</a></p>

<p>The last years of the medieval period of the
woollen industry, which we take as terminating with
the introduction of the 'New Draperies' by foreign
refugees early in the reign of Elizabeth, are chiefly
concerned with the rise of the town clothiers at the
expense of the small country cloth workers, assisted
by Acts which restricted, or at least aimed at restricting,
the industry to corporate boroughs and
market towns, and prohibited any from setting up
in trade without having passed a seven years' apprenticeship.<a name="Anchor-575" id="Anchor-575"></a><a href="#Footnote-575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 575.">[575]</a>
Infringements of these laws were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>frequent, and, thanks to the system of granting a
portion of the fines inflicted to the informer, accusations
were constantly levelled against clothiers for
breaking the various regulations with which the
trade was hedged about.<a name="Anchor-576" id="Anchor-576"></a><a href="#Footnote-576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 576.">[576]</a> Many of the charges fell
through, and in some cases they look like blackmail,
but that offences were sufficiently plentiful is clear.
For the one year, 1562, as many as sixty clothiers
from Kent alone, mostly from the neighbourhood of
Cranbrook and Benenden, were fined for sending
up to London for sale cloths deficient in size, weight,
quality, or colour.<a name="Anchor-577" id="Anchor-577"></a><a href="#Footnote-577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 577.">[577]</a> An absolute fulfilment of all
the regulations was possibly no easy thing, for
although cloths which had been sealed by the
ulnager in the district where they were made were
not supposed to pay ulnage in London the makers
preferred as a rule to pay a halfpenny on each
cloth to the London searchers rather than risk the
results of too close a scrutiny.<a name="Anchor-578" id="Anchor-578"></a><a href="#Footnote-578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 578.">[578]</a></p>

<p>Of the many local varieties of cloth made in
England that which derived its name from the
village of Worsted in Norfolk was, on the whole, the
most important. We have seen that by the end of
the thirteenth century worsted weaving was well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>established in Norfolk, and particularly in Norwich,
and that worsted serges and says were articles of
export, while a century later the forms in which these
cloths were made up were very varied. Norwich continued
to hold the monopoly of searching and sealing
worsteds, wherever made, until 1523, when the
industry had grown to such an extent in Yarmouth
that the weavers of that town were licensed to elect
a warden of their own to seal their cloth; the same
privilege was granted to Lynne, provided there were
at least ten householders exercising the trade there;
but in all cases the cloths were to be shorn, dyed,
coloured, and calendered in Norwich.<a name="Anchor-579" id="Anchor-579"></a><a href="#Footnote-579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 579.">[579]</a> When the
art of calendering worsteds, that is to say giving
them a smooth finish by pressing, was introduced in
Norwich is uncertain, but in the second half of the
fifteenth century the 'fete and misterie of calendryng
of worstedes' in London was known only to certain
Frenchmen. An enterprising merchant, William
Halingbury, brought over from Paris one Toisaunts
Burges, to teach the art to English workers, and, in
revenge, one of the London French calenders endeavoured
to have Halingbury arrested on his next
visit to Paris.<a name="Anchor-580" id="Anchor-580"></a><a href="#Footnote-580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 580.">[580]</a> At the beginning of the sixteenth
century a process of dry calendering with 'gommes,
oyles and presses' was introduced, by which inferior
worsteds were made to look like the best quality,
but if touched with wet they at once spotted and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>spoiled. The process was therefore prohibited in
1514, and at the same time the practice of wet
calendering was confined to those who had served
seven years' apprenticeship, and had been admitted
to the craft by the mayor of Norwich or the wardens
of the craft in the county of Norfolk.<a name="Anchor-581" id="Anchor-581"></a><a href="#Footnote-581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 581.">[581]</a></p>

<p>In 1315 cloths of Aylsham (in Norfolk) are coupled
with those of Worsted as not conforming to the old
assize,<a name="Anchor-582" id="Anchor-582"></a><a href="#Footnote-582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 582.">[582]</a> and at the coronation of Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> some
3500 ells of 'Ayllesham' was used for lining armour,
covering cushions and making 1860 pennons with
the arms of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George.<a name="Anchor-583" id="Anchor-583"></a><a href="#Footnote-583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 583.">[583]</a> But as Buckram and
Aylsham are constantly bracketed together,<a name="Anchor-584" id="Anchor-584"></a><a href="#Footnote-584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 584.">[584]</a> being
used, for instance, in 1333 for making hobby horses
(<i>hobihors</i>) for the king's games,<a name="Anchor-585" id="Anchor-585"></a><a href="#Footnote-585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 585.">[585]</a> presumably at
Christmas, it would seem that Aylshams were linen
and not woollen, especially as 'lynge teille de
Eylesham' was famous in the fourteenth century.<a name="Anchor-586" id="Anchor-586"></a><a href="#Footnote-586" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 586.">[586]</a></p>

<p>In the adjacent county of Suffolk the village of
Kersey was an early centre of clothmaking, and gave
its name to a type of cloth which was afterwards
made in a great number of districts. The kerseys
of Suffolk and Essex were exempted in 1376, with
other narrow cloths, from keeping the assize of
coloured cloths,<a name="Anchor-587" id="Anchor-587"></a><a href="#Footnote-587" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 587.">[587]</a> and just a century later the measurement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>for kerseys was set out as 18 yards by 1 yard.<a name="Anchor-588" id="Anchor-588"></a><a href="#Footnote-588" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 588.">[588]</a>
Curiously enough the chief trouble with the assize
of kerseys, at least in the sixteenth century, was not
short measure, but over long, the explanation being
that kerseys paid export duty by the whole cloth,
and it was therefore to the merchant's advantage
to pay duty on a piece of 25 yards rather than to
pay the same duty on 18 yards.<a name="Anchor-589" id="Anchor-589"></a><a href="#Footnote-589" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 589.">[589]</a> Kerseys were
largely made for export, and a petition against
restrictions tending to hamper foreign trade was
presented, about 1537, by the kersey weavers of
Berks., Oxford, Hants, Surrey, and Sussex, and
Yorkshire.<a name="Anchor-590" id="Anchor-590"></a><a href="#Footnote-590" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 590.">[590]</a> These counties were the chief centres
of the manufacture, though Devonshire kerseys were
also made; in Berkshire, Newbury was then the
great seat of the industry, and the kerseys of John
Winchcombe ('Jack of Newbury') in particular had
a more than local fame. Hampshire kerseys was the
generic name applied to these made in Hampshire,
Sussex, and Surrey, but in earlier times the Isle of
Wight had almost a monopoly of the manufacture
in the district. The ulnage accounts for Hampshire
in 1394-5 give ninety names of clothiers for the Isle
of Wight,<a name="Anchor-591" id="Anchor-591"></a><a href="#Footnote-591" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 591.">[591]</a> who made 600 kerseys, and no other kind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>of cloth, and about a century later we find a draper
complaining that when he had bargained with a
London merchant for a certain number of 'kersys
of Wyght' worth £6 he had been put off with Welsh
kerseys worth only £4, 13s. 4d.<a name="Anchor-592" id="Anchor-592"></a><a href="#Footnote-592" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 592.">[592]</a></p>

<p>Suffolk did a considerable trade in a cheap, coarse
variety of cloth known as 'Vesses or set cloths' for
export to the East; and, as it was the recognised
custom to stretch these to the utmost, and they
were bought as unshrunk, this class of cloth was
exempted in 1523 from the regulations as to stretching
cloth.<a name="Anchor-593" id="Anchor-593"></a><a href="#Footnote-593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 593.">[593]</a> Possibly these Vesses were connected
with the 'Western Blankett of Vyse (Wilts.) and
Bekinton.'<a name="Anchor-594" id="Anchor-594"></a><a href="#Footnote-594" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 594.">[594]</a> Blanket is found in 1395 as made at
Maldon and, on the other side of England, at Hereford,
while at an earlier date, in 1360, Guildford
blanket was bought for the royal household.<a name="Anchor-595" id="Anchor-595"></a><a href="#Footnote-595" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 595.">[595]</a> As
Norwich had its 'monk's cloth' and 'canon cloth,'
presumably so called from its suitability for monastic
and canonical habits, unlike the fine cloth of
Worcester, which, we are told, was forbidden to
Benedictines,<a name="Anchor-596" id="Anchor-596"></a><a href="#Footnote-596" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 596.">[596]</a> so we find that the newly made knight
of the Bath had to vest himself in 'hermit's array'
of Colchester russet.<a name="Anchor-597" id="Anchor-597"></a><a href="#Footnote-597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 597.">[597]</a> Most of the cloths made in
Essex were 'streits,' or narrow cloths, of rather a
poor quality, being often coupled with the inferior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>cloths such as cogware and Kendal cloth. Of the
latter a writer of the time of Henry <abbr title="the eighth"><span class="smcap lowercase">VIII.</span></abbr> says, 'I
knowe when a servynge manne was content to goo
in a Kendall cote in sommer and a frysecote in
winter, and with playne white hose made meete

<p>By the sumptuary law of 1363 farm labourers
and others having less than 40s. in goods were to
wear blanket and russet costing not more than 12d.

narrow russet figures at 12d. the ell, while of the
other cheap varieties short blanket, short coloured
cloth, rays, motleys and friezes varied from 2s. to
2s. 4d. the ell.<a name="Anchor-600" id="Anchor-600"></a><a href="#Footnote-600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 600.">[600]</a> Of friezes the two chief types in
use were those of Coventry and Irish friezes, which
might either be made in Ireland or of Irish wool:
these seem to have come into use about the middle
of the fourteenth century, as in 1376 Irish 'Frysseware'
was exempted from ulnage,<a name="Anchor-601" id="Anchor-601"></a><a href="#Footnote-601" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 601.">[601]</a> and about the
same time purchases of Irish frieze for the royal
household become more common, as much as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>nearly 3000 ells of this material being bought in

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX</abbr><br />

<small>LEATHER WORKING</small></h2>


<p>The dressing of skins and preparation of leather
must have been one of the most widely diffused
industries in medieval times, even if it is a little
exaggeration to claim that it was a by-product of
most villages.<a name="Anchor-605" id="Anchor-605"></a><a href="#Footnote-605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 605.">[605]</a> Two different processes were employed,
ox, cow, and calf hides being tanned by
immersion in a decoction of oak bark, while the skins
of deer, sheep, and horses were tawed with alum and
oil, and the two trades were from early times kept
quite separate, tanners and tawyers being forbidden
to work skins appropriated to each other's trade.
A certain concentration of the industry must have
been brought about in 1184, when orders were issued
that no tanner or tawyer should practise his trade
within the bounds of a forest except in a borough
or market town,<a name="Anchor-606" id="Anchor-606"></a><a href="#Footnote-606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 606.">[606]</a> the object being to prevent the
poaching of deer for the sake of their skins. Market
towns had the further advantage of being well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>supplied with the raw material, as butchers were
compelled to bring the hides of their beasts into
market with the meat, and the tanners had the sole
right of purchase, no regrater or middle-man being
allowed to intervene, while on the other hand the
tanners were not allowed to buy the hides outside
the open market.<a name="Anchor-607" id="Anchor-607"></a><a href="#Footnote-607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 607.">[607]</a> Towards the end of the sixteenth
century it was said<a name="Anchor-608" id="Anchor-608"></a><a href="#Footnote-608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 608.">[608]</a> that 'in most villages
of the realm there is some one dresser or worker
of leather, and ... in most of the market towns
three, four, or five, and many great towns 10 or
20, and in London and the suburbs ... to the
number of 200 or very near.' Casting back, we find
at Oxford in 1380 there were twelve tanners, twenty
skinners, twelve cordwainers, or shoemakers, and
four saddlers,<a name="Anchor-609" id="Anchor-609"></a><a href="#Footnote-609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 609.">[609]</a> while in 1300 there were at Colchester
forty householders employed in the various branches
of the leather trade.<a name="Anchor-610" id="Anchor-610"></a><a href="#Footnote-610" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 610.">[610]</a></p>

<p>Originally, no doubt, the leather dresser worked
up his own leather, and as late as 1323 it would seem
that at Shrewsbury cordwainers were allowed to
tan leather,<a name="Anchor-611" id="Anchor-611"></a><a href="#Footnote-611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 611.">[611]</a> but in 1351 the tanners and shoemakers
were definitely forbidden to intermeddle with each
other's craft, and a series of regulations, parliamentary
and municipal, served to separate the
tanners, the curriers, who dressed and suppled the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>rough tanned hides, the tawyers, and the various
branches of leather-workers.</p>

<p>The stock in trade of the tanner was simple. The
inventories of the goods of half a dozen tanners at
Colchester in 1300 are identical in kind though
varying in value;<a name="Anchor-612" id="Anchor-612"></a><a href="#Footnote-612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 612.">[612]</a> each consists of hides, oak bark,
and a number of vats and tubs. In the case of the
tannery at Meaux Abbey<a name="Anchor-613" id="Anchor-613"></a><a href="#Footnote-613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 613.">[613]</a> (the larger monastic
houses usually maintained their own tanneries) in
1396 rather more details are given. There were in
store cow and calf leather, 'sole peces, sclepe, clowthedys,
and wambes' to the value of £14, 10s. 4d.,
15 tubs and various tools, such as 3 'schapyng-knyfes'
and 4 knives for the tan; 400 tan turves
(blocks of bark from which the tan had been extracted),
and 'the tan from all the oaks barked this
year.' The raw hides had first to be soaked, then
treated with lime to remove the hair, and then
washed again before being placed in the tan vat.
Consequently leather-dressers settled 'where they
may have water in brooks and rivers to dress their
leather; without great store of running water they
cannot dress the same.'<a name="Anchor-614" id="Anchor-614"></a><a href="#Footnote-614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 614.">[614]</a> In 1461 William Frankwell,
when making a grant of a meadow at Lewes,
reserved the right to use the ditch on the south side
of the meadow for his hides,<a name="Anchor-615" id="Anchor-615"></a><a href="#Footnote-615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 615.">[615]</a> and complaints of the
fouling of town water supplies by leather workers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>were not unusual.<a name="Anchor-616" id="Anchor-616"></a><a href="#Footnote-616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 616.">[616]</a> The process of tanning was, and
for the best leather still is, extremely slow; the
hides were supposed to lie in the 'wooses' (ooze, or
liquor) for a whole year, and stringent regulations
were issued to prevent the hastening of the process,
to the detriment of the leather. The bark from
which the tan was obtained, and which was so
important a feature of the process that 'barker'
was an alternative name for tanner, had to be only
of oak, the use of ash bark being forbidden; nor
might lime or hot liquor be used, the imbedding of
the vats in hot beds of old tan being prohibited.</p>

<p>Hides, both raw and tanned, ranked with cloth as
a leading article of trade, both home and foreign;<a name="Anchor-617" id="Anchor-617"></a><a href="#Footnote-617" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 617.">[617]</a>
and, like cloth, tanned leather was early subject to
examination by searchers, appointed either by the
craft gild or by the town authorities. As a rule the
searcher's seal was affixed in the market, or at the
particular 'seld' or hall where alone leather might
be sold, but at Bristol in 1415 the searchers were
empowered to examine the hides at the curriers'
houses before they were curried.<a name="Anchor-618" id="Anchor-618"></a><a href="#Footnote-618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 618.">[618]</a> The curriers,
whose business it was to dress the 'red' hides with
tallow,<a name="Anchor-619" id="Anchor-619"></a><a href="#Footnote-619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 619.">[619]</a> rendering them smooth and supple, were not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>allowed to dress badly tanned hides.<a name="Anchor-620" id="Anchor-620"></a><a href="#Footnote-620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 620.">[620]</a> Several
grades of tanning were recognised, the most lengthy
and thorough workmanship being required for
leather intended for the soles of boots and rather less
for the uppers. When forty-seven hides belonging
to Nicholas Burle, of London, were seized in 1378
as not well tanned, he admitted that they were not
fit for shoeleather, but urged that he intended to sell
them to saddlers, girdlers, and makers of leather
bottles: a mixed jury of these various trades, however,
condemned the hides as unfit for any purpose,
and they were forfeited.<a name="Anchor-621" id="Anchor-621"></a><a href="#Footnote-621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 621.">[621]</a></p>

<p>Although there was thus an efficient control
exercised over tanned leather, the tawed soft leathers
used by glovers, pointmakers, pursemakers, saddlers,
girdlers, coffermakers, budgetmakers, stationers, etc.,
seem for the most part to have escaped supervision,
with the result that at the end of the sixteenth
century the markets were flooded with counterfeit
leathers.<a name="Anchor-622" id="Anchor-622"></a><a href="#Footnote-622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 622.">[622]</a></p>

<p>'The leather dressed with oil is made more
supple, soft and spongey, and is wrought with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>rough cotton, as bayes and fresadoes are, the cotton
being raised in the fulling mill where cloth is fulled,
and serveth for the more beauty and pleasure to
the wearer.</p>

<p>'The leather dressed with alum and oker is more
tough and "thight," serving better for the use of
the poor artificer, husbandman, and labourer, and
a more easy price by half, and is wrought smooth
or with cotton which is raised by hand with a card
or other like tool, and as the alum giveth strength and
toughness, the oker giveth it colour, like as the oil
doth give colour to Buff and Shamoys.</p>

<p>'And this diversity of dressing, with oil or alum,
is to be discerned both by smell and by a dust which
ariseth from the alum leather....</p>

<p>'All Shamoys leather is made of goat skins
brought for the most part out of Barbury, from the

wrought. And there is much thereof made from
skins from Wales and other parts within the realm....
Being dressed with oil it beareth the name

<p>'Shamoys<a name="Anchor-623" id="Anchor-623"></a><a href="#Footnote-623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 623.">[623]</a> is made of goat, buck, doe, hind,
sore, sorrell, and sheepskins. The true way of
dressing is in "trayne oyle," the counterfeit is with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>alum and is worth about half.... Shamoys
dressed in train oil can be dressed again three or
four times, and seem as good as new, but dressed
in alum it will hardly dress twice and will soon be
spied. And when Shamoys dressed in alum cometh
to the rain or any water they will be hard like tanned
leather, and Shamoys in oil make the cheapest and
most lasting apparel, which the "low countrie man
and the highe Almayn" doth use.'</p>

<p>Frauds in the preparation and sale of leather were
of frequent occurrence, and in 1372 the mayor and
aldermen of London ordained penalties for the sale
of dyed sheep and calf leather scraped and prepared
so as to look like roe leather. At the same time the
leather dyers were forbidden to dye such counterfeit
leathers, and also to use the brasil or other dye
provided or selected by one customer for the goods
of another.<a name="Anchor-624" id="Anchor-624"></a><a href="#Footnote-624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 624.">[624]</a> With the same object of preventing
frauds the tawyers who worked for furriers were not
allowed to cut the heads off the skins which they
dressed, and were also liable to imprisonment if
they worked old furs up into leather.<a name="Anchor-625" id="Anchor-625"></a><a href="#Footnote-625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 625.">[625]</a> Further
penalties for false and deceitful work, especially in
the making of leather 'points and lanyers,' or laces
and thongs, were enacted in 1398.<a name="Anchor-626" id="Anchor-626"></a><a href="#Footnote-626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 626.">[626]</a> With the growth
of capitalism during the reign of Elizabeth the
control exercised by the Leathersellers' Company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>became almost nominal, some half a dozen wealthy
members of the company getting the whole trade
into their own hands. By buying up the leather
all over the country, they forced up prices; having,
moreover, a practical monopoly of tawed leathers
they were able to make the glovers and other leather
workers take the dressed skins in packets of a dozen,
which contained three or four small 'linings' or
worthless skins.<a name="Anchor-627" id="Anchor-627"></a><a href="#Footnote-627" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 627.">[627]</a> They also undertook the dressing
of the skins, and cut out the good workmen by
scamping their work and employing men who had
only served half their seven years' apprenticeship.<a name="Anchor-628" id="Anchor-628"></a><a href="#Footnote-628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 628.">[628]</a>
They also caused dogskins, 'fishe skynnes of zeale,'
calf, and other skins to be so dressed as to resemble
'right Civill [<i>i.e.</i> Seville] and Spannish skynnes,'
worth twice as much. These skins were dressed
'with the powder of date stones and of gaule and
with French shomake that is nothinge like the
Spannish shomake, to give them a pretie sweete
savor but nothinge like to the civile skynnes, and the
powder of theise is of veary smale price and the
powder of right Spannish shomake grounded in a
mill is wourth xxx<sup>s</sup> the c<sup>lb</sup> weight, which shomake
is a kynd of brush, shrubb, or heath in Spayne and
groweth low by the ground and is swete like Gale<a name="Anchor-629" id="Anchor-629"></a><a href="#Footnote-629" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 629.">[629]</a>

dried and grounded into powder by milles and dresseth

general demand that tawed leather should be
searched and sealed in the same way as tanned, and
in 1593 Edmund Darcy turned this to his own
advantage by obtaining a royal grant of the right
to carry out such searching and sealing. This was
opposed by the leather-sellers, on the grounds that
it would interfere with the sale and purchase in
country districts if buyer and seller had to wait till
the searcher could attend, and that the proposed
fees for sealing were exorbitant, amounting to from
a ninth to nearly a half of the value of the skins.
They also said that if a seal were put on, it would
almost always be pared away, washed out, or 'extincte
by dying' before the leather reached the
consumer.<a name="Anchor-631" id="Anchor-631"></a><a href="#Footnote-631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 631.">[631]</a> Upon examination the suggested fees
were found to be too large, and a table of the different
kinds of leather and their values was drawn up, and
fees fixed accordingly:<a name="Anchor-632" id="Anchor-632"></a><a href="#Footnote-632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 632.">[632]</a>—</p>

<p>A number of trades, such as glovers, saddlers,
pursemakers, girdlers, and bottlemakers, used
leather, but the most important class were the shoemakers.
They in turn were divided into a number
of branches, at the head of which stood the cordwainers,
who derived their name from having originally
been workers of Cordovan leather, but were in
actual practice makers of the better class of shoes.<a name="Anchor-637" id="Anchor-637"></a><a href="#Footnote-637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 637.">[637]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>At the other end were the cobblers, or menders of
old shoes. Elaborate regulations were made in
London in 1409 to prevent these two classes trespassing
on one another's preserves.<a name="Anchor-638" id="Anchor-638"></a><a href="#Footnote-638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 638.">[638]</a> The cobbler
might clout an old sole with new leather or patch
the uppers, but if the boot required an entirely
new sole, or if a new shoe were burnt or broken and
required a fresh piece put in, then the work must
be given to the cordwainer. A distinction was also
drawn at a much earlier date, in 1271,<a name="Anchor-639" id="Anchor-639"></a><a href="#Footnote-639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 639.">[639]</a> between two
classes of cordwainers, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">allutarii</i> and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">basanarii</i>,
the latter being those who used 'basan' or 'bazan,'
an inferior leather made from sheepskin. Neither
was to use the other's craft, though the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">allutarius</i>
might make the uppers (<i>quissellos</i>) of his shoes of
bazan: to prevent any confusion the two classes
were to occupy separate positions in the fairs and
markets. In 1320 we find eighty pairs of shoes
seized from twenty different persons, thirty-one
pairs being taken from Roger Brown of Norwich,
and forfeited for being made of bazan and cordwain
mixed.<a name="Anchor-640" id="Anchor-640"></a><a href="#Footnote-640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 640.">[640]</a> Fifty years later, in 1375, a heavy fine
was ordained for any one selling shoes of bazan as
being cordwain,<a name="Anchor-641" id="Anchor-641"></a><a href="#Footnote-641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 641.">[641]</a> and a similar ordinance was in
force at Bristol in 1408.<a name="Anchor-642" id="Anchor-642"></a><a href="#Footnote-642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 642.">[642]</a> By the London rules of
1271, no cordwainer was to keep more than eight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>journeymen (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">servientes</i>), and at Bristol in 1364 the
shoemakers were restricted to a single 'covenant-hynd,'
who was to be paid 18d. a week and allowed
eight pairs of shoes yearly.<a name="Anchor-643" id="Anchor-643"></a><a href="#Footnote-643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 643.">[643]</a> In the case of Bristol,
however, no limit is stated for the number of journeymen,
who were paid by piecework, the rates being,
in 1364, 3d. a dozen for sewing, and 3d. for yarking;
3d. for making a pair of boots entirely, that is to say,
1d. for cutting and 2d. for sewing and yarking;
2d. for cutting a dozen pairs of shoes, namely 1d.
for the overleathers and 1d. for the soles, and a
further 1d. for lasting the dozen shoes. The rates
of pay were still the same in 1408, though there are
additional entries of 12d. for sewing, yarking, and
finishing a dozen boots and shoes called 'quarter-schone,'
and 7d. for sewing and yarking, with an
extra 1½d. for finishing a dozen shoes called 'course
ware.'<a name="Anchor-644" id="Anchor-644"></a><a href="#Footnote-644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 644.">[644]</a></p>

<p>The sale of the finished articles was also an object
of regulations: in London in 1271, shoes might only
be hawked in the district between Corveiserstrete
and Soperes Lane, and there only in the morning
on ordinary days, though on the eves of feast they
might be sold in the afternoon.<a name="Anchor-645" id="Anchor-645"></a><a href="#Footnote-645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 645.">[645]</a> Leather laces
also might not be sold at the 'eve chepings.'<a name="Anchor-646" id="Anchor-646"></a><a href="#Footnote-646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 646.">[646]</a>
Possibly it was considered that bad leather might
be more easily passed off in a bad light, but the idea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>may simply have been to prevent the competition
of the pedlars and hawkers with the shopkeepers.
At Northampton, in 1452, the two classes of tradesmen
were separated, those who had shops not being
allowed to sell also in the market.<a name="Anchor-647" id="Anchor-647"></a><a href="#Footnote-647" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 647.">[647]</a> Northampton
had not at this date begun to acquire the fame
which it earned during the seventeenth century as
the centre of the English boot trade, but regulations
for the 'corvysers crafte' there had been drawn up
in 1402,<a name="Anchor-648" id="Anchor-648"></a><a href="#Footnote-648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 648.">[648]</a> and much earlier, in 1266, we find
Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> ordering the bailiffs of Northampton to
provide a hundred and fifty pairs of shoes, half at
5d. and half at 4d. the pair.<a name="Anchor-649" id="Anchor-649"></a><a href="#Footnote-649" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 649.">[649]</a> These were for distribution
to the poor; and similar orders in other
years were usually executed in either London or
Winchester: no particular importance can be attached
to this single order being given to Northampton,
as presumably any large town could have
carried out the order. So far as any town can be
placed at the head of the shoemaking industry, the
distinction must be given to Oxford where the cordwainers'
gild was in existence early in the twelfth
century, it being reconstituted in 1131,<a name="Anchor-650" id="Anchor-650"></a><a href="#Footnote-650" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 650.">[650]</a> and its
monopoly confirmed by Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr><a name="Anchor-651" id="Anchor-651"></a><a href="#Footnote-651" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 651.">[651]</a></p>

<small>BREWING—ALE, BEER, CIDER</small></h2>


<p>Malt liquors have been from time immemorial the
national drink of England, but the ale of medieval
times was quite different from the liquor which now
passes indifferently under the names ale or beer. It
was more of a sweet wort, of about the consistency
of barley water. Andrew Borde,<a name="Anchor-652" id="Anchor-652"></a><a href="#Footnote-652" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 652.">[652]</a> writing in the
first half of the sixteenth century, says: 'Ale is
made of malte and water; and they the which do
put any other thynge to ale than is rehersed, except
yest, barme or godesgood, doth sofysticat theyr ale.
Ale for an Englysshe man is a naturall drynke. Ale
must have these propertyes: it muste be fresshe and
cleare, it muste not be ropy nor smoky, nor must it
have no weft nor tayle. Ale should not be dronke
under v dayes olde. Newe ale is unholsome for all
men. And sowre ale, and dead ale the which doth
stand a tylt, is good for no man. Barly malte
maketh better ale then oten malte or any other
corne doth: it doth ingendre grose humoures; but
yette it maketh a man stronge.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>The supremacy of English ale was already established
by the middle of the twelfth century, that of
Canterbury being particularly famous,<a name="Anchor-653" id="Anchor-653"></a><a href="#Footnote-653" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 653.">[653]</a> and casks
of ale were amongst the presents taken by Becket
to the French court on the occasion of his embassy
in 1157.<a name="Anchor-654" id="Anchor-654"></a><a href="#Footnote-654" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 654.">[654]</a> At this time it really deserved the title
of 'the people's food in liquid form'; the consumption
per head of population must have been enormous,
the ordinary monastic corrody, or allowance of
food, stipulating for a gallon of good ale a day, with
very often a second gallon of weak ale. It must
be borne in mind that it was drunk at all times,
taking the place not only of such modern inventions
as tea and coffee, but also of water, insomuch that
a thirteenth-century writer describing the extreme
poverty of the Franciscans when they first settled
in London (<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1224) exclaims, 'I have seen the
brothers drink ale so sour that some would have
preferred to drink water.'<a name="Anchor-655" id="Anchor-655"></a><a href="#Footnote-655" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 655.">[655]</a> Such was the importance
attached to ale that it was coupled with bread
for purposes of legal supervision, and the right to
hold the 'assize of bread and ale' was one of the
earliest justicial privileges asserted by municipal
and other local courts. The Assize of Ale as recorded
on the Statute Rolls in the time of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> fixed
the maximum price of ale throughout the kingdom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>on the basis of the price of malt, or rather of the
corn from which malt was made.<a name="Anchor-656" id="Anchor-656"></a><a href="#Footnote-656" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 656.">[656]</a> When wheat
stood at 3s. or 3s. 4d. the quarter, barley at 20d. to
2s., and oats at 16d., then brewers in towns were to
sell two gallons of ale for a penny, and outside towns
three or four gallons. And when three gallons were
sold for a penny in a town then four gallons should
be sold for a penny in the country. If corn rose a
shilling the quarter, the price of ale might be raised
a farthing the gallon.<a name="Anchor-657" id="Anchor-657"></a><a href="#Footnote-657" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 657.">[657]</a> A later ordinance, issued in
1283, set the price of the better quality of ale at
1½d.; and that of the weaker at 1d., and the commonalty
of Bristol, fearing that they might be punished
if the brewers of the town broke this regulation,
issued stringent orders for its observance, infringement
entailing the forfeiture of the offender's
brewery.<a name="Anchor-658" id="Anchor-658"></a><a href="#Footnote-658" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 658.">[658]</a></p>

<p>A very casual examination of court rolls and other
local records is sufficient to convince the student
that brewing was universal, every village supplying
its own wants, and that infringements of the regulations
by which the trade was supposed to be controlled
were almost equally universal. The same
names are found, where any series of rolls exists,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>presented at court after court for breaking the
assize in one way or another, and it is clear that a
strict observance of the laws was difficult, it being
more profitable to break them and pay the small
fines extorted practically as licensing dues. At
Shoreham in the thirteenth century, the brewers,
whose trade was particularly active because of the
numbers of foreigners who visited the port, paid
2½ marks yearly to escape the vexations of the
manorial court,<a name="Anchor-659" id="Anchor-659"></a><a href="#Footnote-659" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 659.">[659]</a> and in the same way the hundred
of Shoyswell (in Sussex) paid a yearly fine in order
that the ale-wives (trade was largely in the hands of
women) might be excused attendance at the law-days.<a name="Anchor-660" id="Anchor-660"></a><a href="#Footnote-660" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 660.">[660]</a>
In neither case, however, can we suppose
that the manorial control over the brewing trade
was appreciably relaxed, but rather that personal
attendance at the court, with its interruption of
business, was dispensed with. Besides these monetary
payments, there were often payments in kind
due to the lord of the manor or borough. At Marlborough
every public brewery had to pay to the
constable of the castle from each brew a measure,
known as 'tolsester,' prior to 1232, when this render
of ale was granted to the canons of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Margaret's.<a name="Anchor-661" id="Anchor-661"></a><a href="#Footnote-661" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 661.">[661]</a>
'Tolsester' was also paid to the castle of Chester,<a name="Anchor-662" id="Anchor-662"></a><a href="#Footnote-662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 662.">[662]</a>
and in Newark and Fiskerton.<a name="Anchor-663" id="Anchor-663"></a><a href="#Footnote-663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 663.">[663]</a> The 'sester'
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sextarius</i>) or 'cestron' was, in Coventry at any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>rate, 13 or 14 gallons.<a name="Anchor-664" id="Anchor-664"></a><a href="#Footnote-664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 664.">[664]</a> Ale was always supposed
to be sold, whether in gross or retail, in measures of
which the capacity had been certified by the seal or
stamp of the official appointed for the purpose.<a name="Anchor-665" id="Anchor-665"></a><a href="#Footnote-665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 665.">[665]</a>
The list of standard measures kept at Beverley in
1423 shows a potell, quart, pint, and gill of pewter,
panyers, hopir, modius, firthindal, piece, and half-piece
of wood and a gallon, potell, third and quart,
also of wood.<a name="Anchor-666" id="Anchor-666"></a><a href="#Footnote-666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 666.">[666]</a> Court Rolls, however, show that the
use of unstamped measures and the retailing of ale
in pitchers and jugs (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per ciphos et discos</i>) was of
constant occurrence,<a name="Anchor-667" id="Anchor-667"></a><a href="#Footnote-667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 667.">[667]</a> mainly, no doubt, for the
convenience of customers who brought their own
jugs, but also occasionally with intent to deceive,
as in the case of Alice Causton,<a name="Anchor-668" id="Anchor-668"></a><a href="#Footnote-668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 668.">[668]</a> who in 1364 filled
up the bottom of a quart measure with pitch and
cunningly sprinkled it with sprigs of rosemary,<a name="Anchor-669" id="Anchor-669"></a><a href="#Footnote-669" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 669.">[669]</a>
for which she had to 'play bo pepe thorowe a pillery.'
It is interesting to notice that at Torksey in 1345, if
a woman was accused of selling ale 'against the
assize,' she might clear herself by the oaths of two
other women, preferably her next-door neighbours.<a name="Anchor-670" id="Anchor-670"></a><a href="#Footnote-670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 670.">[670]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>When a public brewer had made a fresh brew he
had to send for the official 'ale-conner' or 'taster,'
or to signify that his services were required by putting
out in front of his house an 'ale stake,' a pole
with a branch or bush at the end: this was also
used as the universal sign of a tavern; and some
of the London taverners, possibly recognising that
their liquor was not sufficiently good to 'need no
bush,' made their ale-stakes so long as to be dangerous
to persons riding in the street.<a name="Anchor-671" id="Anchor-671"></a><a href="#Footnote-671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 671.">[671]</a> No ale might
be sold until it had been approved by the ale-conner.
If the latter found the ale fit for consumption but
not of full quality, he might fix the price at which it
might be sold.<a name="Anchor-672" id="Anchor-672"></a><a href="#Footnote-672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 672.">[672]</a> In Worcester the instructions to
the ale-conner were, 'You shall resort to every
brewer's house within this city on their tunning day
and there to taste their ale, whether it be good and
wholesome for man's body, and whether they make
it from time to time according to the prices fixed.
So help you God.'<a name="Anchor-673" id="Anchor-673"></a><a href="#Footnote-673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 673.">[673]</a> There seems reason for the pious
ejaculation when we find that in Coventry in 1520
there were in a total population of 6600 men, women,
and children, 60 public brewers.<a name="Anchor-674" id="Anchor-674"></a><a href="#Footnote-674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 674.">[674]</a> When the ale
was good the task must have had its compensations,
but when it was bad the taster must often have
wished to make the punishment fit the crime, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>was done in the case of a Londoner who sold bad
wine, the offender being compelled to drink a
draught of the wine, the rest of which was then
poured over his head.<a name="Anchor-675" id="Anchor-675"></a><a href="#Footnote-675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 675.">[675]</a> Our sympathy may in
particular be extended to the ale-tasters of Cornwall,
where 'ale is starke nought, lokinge whyte and
thycke, as pygges had wrasteled in it.'<a name="Anchor-676" id="Anchor-676"></a><a href="#Footnote-676" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 676.">[676]</a> Oddly
enough we find mention in Domesday Book of forty-three
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cervisiarii</i> at Helstone in Cornwall; they are
usually supposed to be tenants who paid dues of
ale, but the term is clearly used in the description of
Bury <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Edmunds for brewers. In the sixteenth
century, however, Borde<a name="Anchor-677" id="Anchor-677"></a><a href="#Footnote-677" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 677.">[677]</a> in an unflattering dialect
poem makes the Cornishman say:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">'Iche cam a Cornyshe man, ale che can brew;</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">It wyll make one to kacke, also to spew;</div>
      <div class="verse">It is dycke and smoky, and also it is dyn;</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">It is lyke wash as pygges had wrestled dryn.'</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To ensure the purity of the ale not only was
the finished product examined, but some care was
taken to prevent the use of impure water, regulations
to prevent the contamination of water used
by brewers, or the use by them of water so contaminated,
being common.<a name="Anchor-678" id="Anchor-678"></a><a href="#Footnote-678" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 678.">[678]</a> On the other hand,
owing to the large quantities of water required for
their business, they were forbidden in London,<a name="Anchor-679" id="Anchor-679"></a><a href="#Footnote-679" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 679.">[679]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>Bristol,<a name="Anchor-680" id="Anchor-680"></a><a href="#Footnote-680" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 680.">[680]</a> and Coventry<a name="Anchor-681" id="Anchor-681"></a><a href="#Footnote-681" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 681.">[681]</a> to use the public conduits.
For the actual brewing, rules were also laid down.
In Oxford in 1449, in which year nine brewers were
said to brew weak and unwholesome ale, not properly
prepared, and not worth its price, but of little or no
value, the brewers were made to swear that they
would brew in wholesome manner so that they
would continue to heat the water over the fire so
long as it emitted froth, and would skim the froth
off, and that after skimming the new ale should
stand long enough for the dregs to settle before they
sent it out, Richard Benet in particular undertaking
that his ale should stand for at least twelve hours
before he sent it to any hall or college.<a name="Anchor-682" id="Anchor-682"></a><a href="#Footnote-682" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 682.">[682]</a> In London
also casks when filled in the brewery were to stand
for a day and a night to work, so that when taken
away the ale should be clear and good.<a name="Anchor-683" id="Anchor-683"></a><a href="#Footnote-683" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 683.">[683]</a> This
explains the regulation at Coventry in 1421 that ale
'new under the here syve [hair sieve]' was to sell
for 1¼d. the gallon, and that 'good and stale' for
1½d.<a name="Anchor-684" id="Anchor-684"></a><a href="#Footnote-684" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 684.">[684]</a> At Seaford there was a third state, 'in the
hoffe,' or 'huff,' which sold for 2d.<a name="Anchor-685" id="Anchor-685"></a><a href="#Footnote-685" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 685.">[685]</a></p>

<p>So far were the brewers regarded as the servants
of the people that not only was their brewing strictly
regulated, but they were compelled to brew even
when they considered that new ordinances<a name="Anchor-686" id="Anchor-686"></a><a href="#Footnote-686" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 686.">[686]</a> or a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>rise in the price of malt would make their trade
unprofitable;<a name="Anchor-687" id="Anchor-687"></a><a href="#Footnote-687" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 687.">[687]</a> and in 1434 the brewers of Oxford
were summoned to <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Mary's Church and there
ordered to provide malt, and to see to it that two or
three brewers brewed twice or thrice every week,
and sent out their ale.<a name="Anchor-688" id="Anchor-688"></a><a href="#Footnote-688" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 688.">[688]</a> At Gloucester,<a name="Anchor-689" id="Anchor-689"></a><a href="#Footnote-689" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 689.">[689]</a> in the
sixteenth century, the brewers were expected to
give some kind of weak wort, possibly the scum or
dregs of their brew, to the poor to make up into a
kind of very small beer, which must have been
something like the 'second washing of the tuns,'
which formed the perquisite of the under brewers
at Rochester Priory.<a name="Anchor-690" id="Anchor-690"></a><a href="#Footnote-690" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 690.">[690]</a> At Norwich barm or yeast
was a similar subject of charity, and in 1468 it
was set forth that 'wheras berme otherwise clepid
goddisgood, without tyme of mynde hath frely be
yoven or delyvered for brede whete malte egges
or othir honest rewarde to the value only of a
farthyng at the uttermost and noon warned [<i>i.e.</i>
denied], because it cometh of the grete grace of God;
certeyn ... comon brewers ... for ther singler
lucre and avayle have nowe newely begonne to take
monye for their seid goddisgood,' charging a halfpenny
or a penny for the least amount, therefore
the brewers were to swear that 'for the time ye or
your wife exercise comon brewing ye shall graunte
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>and delyver to any person axyng berme called
goddisgood takyng for as moche goddisgood as shall
be sufficient for the brewe of a quarter malte a
ferthyng at the moost,' provided that they have
enough for their own use, and that this do not
apply to any 'old custom' between the brewers
and bakers.<a name="Anchor-691" id="Anchor-691"></a><a href="#Footnote-691" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 691.">[691]</a></p>


<p class="mt2">About the end of the fourteenth century a new
variety of malt liquor, beer, was introduced from
Flanders. It seems to have been imported into
Winchelsea as early as 1400,<a name="Anchor-692" id="Anchor-692"></a><a href="#Footnote-692" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 692.">[692]</a> but for the best part of
a century its use was mainly, and its manufacture
entirely, confined to foreigners. Andrew Borde,<a name="Anchor-693" id="Anchor-693"></a><a href="#Footnote-693" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 693.">[693]</a>
who disapproved of it, says, 'Bere is made of malte,
of hoppes and water: it is a naturall drynke for a
Dutche man. And nowe of late dayes it is moche
used in Englande to the detryment of many Englysshe
men; specyally it kylleth them the which be troubled
with the colycke and the stone and the strangulion;
for the drynke is a colde drynke; yet it doth make
a man fat, and doth inflate the bely, as it dothe
appeare by the Dutche mens faces and belyes. If
the bere be well served and be fyned and not new it
doth qualify the heat of the lyver.' That, thanks
to the large foreign settlement in London, beer
brewing soon attained considerable dimensions in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>the city is evident from the fact that in 1418, when
provisions were sent to Henry <abbr title="the fifth"><span class="smcap lowercase">V.</span></abbr> at the siege of
Rouen, 300 tuns of 'ber' were sent from London,
and only 200 tuns of ale, but the beer was valued at
only 13s. 4d. the tun, while the ale was 20s.<a name="Anchor-694" id="Anchor-694"></a><a href="#Footnote-694" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 694.">[694]</a> About
the middle of the fifteenth century large quantities
of hops were being imported at Rye and Winchelsea,
and in the church of the neighbouring village of
Playden may still be seen the grave of Cornelius
Zoetmann, ornamented with two beer barrels and
a crossed mash-stick and fork.<a name="Anchor-695" id="Anchor-695"></a><a href="#Footnote-695" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 695.">[695]</a> A little later we
find beer being exported from the Sussex ports and
also from Poole,<a name="Anchor-696" id="Anchor-696"></a><a href="#Footnote-696" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 696.">[696]</a> which had long done a large trade
in ale to the Channel Islands.</p>

<p>Such beer brewers as occur during the fifteenth
century almost all bear foreign names. For instance,
in 1473, Thomas Seyntleger and John
Goryng of Southwark recovered heavy damages for
theft against John Doys of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Botolph's-outside-Aldgate
and Gerard Sconeburgh of Southwark, 'berebruers,'
whose sureties were Godfrey Speryng and
Edward Dewysse, also 'berebruers.'<a name="Anchor-697" id="Anchor-697"></a><a href="#Footnote-697" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 697.">[697]</a> Probably
in this case the theft was an illegal seizure or distraint
of goods for a debt for beer supplied, as
although most of the goods said to be stolen were
armour and objects of value, such as a book of
Gower's poems and an illuminated <cite>Sege of Troye</cite>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>there were also ten barrels of 'sengilbere,' thirty-five
barrels of 'dowblebere,' ten lastys of barrels and
kilderkins, and two great sacks for 'hoppys.' There
was still a prejudice against beer, and in 1471, at
Norwich, the use of hops and 'gawle' in brewing
was forbidden,<a name="Anchor-698" id="Anchor-698"></a><a href="#Footnote-698" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 698.">[698]</a> while in 1519 the authorities at
Shrewsbury prohibited the employment of the
'wicked and pernicious weed, hops.'<a name="Anchor-699" id="Anchor-699"></a><a href="#Footnote-699" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 699.">[699]</a> In the same
way, in 1531, the royal brewer was forbidden to use
hops or brimstone, but an Act of Parliament passed
in the same year bore testimony to the establishment
of the industry by exempting alien brewers from
the penal statutes against foreigners practising their
trades in England, and also by allowing beer brewers
to employ two coopers while ale brewers might only
employ one.<a name="Anchor-700" id="Anchor-700"></a><a href="#Footnote-700" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 700.">[700]</a> At the same time the barrel of beer
was fixed at thirty-six gallons, and that of ale at
thirty-two, the kilderkin and firkin being respectively
half and quarter of those amounts.</p>

<p>From this time the brewing of beer steadily
prospered, the Leakes of Southwark<a name="Anchor-701" id="Anchor-701"></a><a href="#Footnote-701" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 701.">[701]</a> and other alien
brewers amassing great riches, English brewers
following in their footsteps, and the taste for beer
spreading through the country so rapidly that in
1577 Harrison in his <cite>Description of England</cite> could
speak contemptuously of the old ale as thick and
fulsome and no longer popular except with a few.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>William Harrison, writing about 1577, says: 'In
some places of England there is a kind of drinke
made of apples, which they call cider or pomage,
but that of peares is named pirrie, and both are
ground and pressed in presses made for the nonce.
Certes, these two are verie common in Sussex, Kent,
Worcester, and other steads where these sorts of
fruits do abound, howbeit they are not their onelie
drinke at all times, but referred unto the delicate
sorts of drinke.'<a name="Anchor-702" id="Anchor-702"></a><a href="#Footnote-702" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 702.">[702]</a> A generation earlier Andrew
Borde, whom we have already quoted for ale and
beer, wrote: 'Cyder is made of the juce of peeres,
or of the juce of apples; and other whyle cyder is
made of both; but the best cyder is made of cleane
peeres, the which be dulcet; but the beste is not
praysed in physycke, for cyder is colde of operacyon,
and is full of ventosyte, wherfore it doth ingendre
evyll humours and doth swage to moche the naturall
heate of man and doth let dygestyon and doth hurte
the stomacke; but they the whych be used to it,
yf it be dronken in harvyst it doth lytell harme.'</p>

<p>Andrew Borde makes no distinction between cider
and perry. We find mention of the latter in 1505,
when a foreign ship entered Poole with a cargo of
apples, pears, etc., and '3 poncheons de pery,'
valued at 10s.,<a name="Anchor-703" id="Anchor-703"></a><a href="#Footnote-703" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 703.">[703]</a> but references to perry are not
numerous. Cider, on the other hand, we find in
constant demand from the middle of the twelfth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>century onwards. It figures on the Pipe Rolls of
Henry <abbr title="the second"><span class="smcap lowercase">II.</span></abbr>,<a name="Anchor-704" id="Anchor-704"></a><a href="#Footnote-704" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 704.">[704]</a> and the contemporary historian and
journalist, Gerald de Barri, alleged its use by the
monks of Canterbury instead of Kentish ale as an
instance of their luxury.<a name="Anchor-705" id="Anchor-705"></a><a href="#Footnote-705" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 705.">[705]</a> A little later, in 1212, the
sale of cider is one of the numerous sources of the
income of the Abbey of Battle;<a name="Anchor-706" id="Anchor-706"></a><a href="#Footnote-706" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 706.">[706]</a> part of this cider
may have come from its estates at Wye, which
produced a good deal of cider during the fourteenth
century.<a name="Anchor-707" id="Anchor-707"></a><a href="#Footnote-707" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 707.">[707]</a></p>

<p>Possibly the industry was introduced from Normandy,
from which district large quantities of cider
were imported into Winchelsea about 1270,<a name="Anchor-708" id="Anchor-708"></a><a href="#Footnote-708" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 708.">[708]</a> and this
might account for the hold which it took upon
Sussex. In the western part of the county, at
Pagham, we find mention of an apple mill and press
having been wrongfully seized by the escheator's
officer in 1275,<a name="Anchor-709" id="Anchor-709"></a><a href="#Footnote-709" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 709.">[709]</a> and at the same place in 1313 the
farmer of the archbishop's estates accounted for
12s. spent on buying four casks in which to put
cider, on repairing a ciderpress, and on the wages of
men hired to make cider.<a name="Anchor-710" id="Anchor-710"></a><a href="#Footnote-710" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 710.">[710]</a> It is, however, in the
Nonae Rolls of 1341 that the extent of the cider
industry in Sussex is most noticeable.<a name="Anchor-711" id="Anchor-711"></a><a href="#Footnote-711" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 711.">[711]</a> In no fewer
than eighty parishes, of which seventy-four were in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>West Sussex, the tithes of cider are mentioned as
part of the endowment of the church, and in another
twenty-eight cases the tithes of apples are entered.
Moreover the value of these tithes was very considerable,
reaching 100s. in Easebourne, and as much as
10 marks (£6, 13s. 4d.) at Wisborough. In the last-named
parish in 1385, William Threle granted to
John Pakenham and his wife certain gardens and
orchards, reserving to himself half the trees bearing
fruit either for eating or for cider (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mangable et
ciserable</i>), in return for which they were to render
yearly a pipe of cider and a quarter of store apples
(<i>hordapplen</i>); he also retained the right of access to
the 'wringehouse,' or building containing the press,
and the right to use their ciderpress for his fruit.<a name="Anchor-712" id="Anchor-712"></a><a href="#Footnote-712" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 712.">[712]</a></p>

<p>Beyond an abundance of casual references to
cider presses and to the purchases and sale of cider,
there is little to record of the industry in medieval
times; nor need we devote much attention to the
manufacture of wine in England. Domesday Book
shows us that the great Norman lords in many cases
planted vines near their chief seats, and not many
years later William of Malmesbury spoke of the
Vale of Gloucester as planted more thickly with
vineyards than any other part of England, and producing
the best grapes, from which a wine little
inferior to those of France was made. Vines continued
to be grown by the great lords and monasteries,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>but the wine was used entirely for their own
consumption, and in decreasing quantities. About
1500 an Italian visitor speaks of having eaten
English grapes, and adds 'wine might be made in
the southern parts, but it would be harsh,'<a name="Anchor-713" id="Anchor-713"></a><a href="#Footnote-713" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 713.">[713]</a> from
which we may judge that such wine making as had
existed was at an end by the sixteenth century.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI</abbr><br />

<small>THE CONTROL OF INDUSTRY</small></h2>


<p>The control of industry is a subject for the treatment
of which there are materials sufficient for more
than one large volume. I do not, however, regret
that I can devote comparatively small space to the
subject, as its principles are simple and admit of
broad treatment. There is, moreover, in the case
of the student who is not a specialist, a danger of
obscuring the outlines with a multiplicity of detail.
And there is also the danger of selecting some puzzling
and obscure incident or enactment, due to local
causes of which we are ignorant, and using it as a
basis for ingenious generalisations. Broadly speaking,
the Control of Industry may be said to be
either External, by parliamentary or municipal
legislation, or Internal, by means of craft gilds.
These two sections again admit of subdivision
according as their objects are the protection of the
consumer, the employer or the workman. Nor can
we entirely ignore legislation for purposes of revenue—subsidies,
customs, and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">octroi</i> dues.</p>

<p>Of industrial legislation by the King's Council,
the predecessor of Parliament, we find very little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>trace. The royal charters of the twelfth century
confirming or licensing craft gilds may be more
justly regarded as revenue enactments, their object
being rather to secure a certain annual return from
the craft to which the royal protection was granted
than to exercise any control over the craft. The
proclamation in the early thirteenth century of the
Assize of Cloth and of the Assize of Bread and Ale
may be considered to mark the beginning of a national
control of industry, though in each case existing
regulations were formally adopted rather than new
rules imposed. The growth of the towns and the
rise of a wealthy merchant class during the reign
of Henry <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> brought about the birth of Parliament,
and naturally led to a certain amount of trade
legislation. But with trade—the distribution of
finished products by persons other than the producers—we
are not concerned. Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>, thanks
perhaps to his queen Philippa, from the cloth land
of Hainault, realised the possibilities of the English
cloth manufacture, and endeavoured to foster it by
a series of statutes to which reference has been made
above. During his reign, in 1349, the Black Death,
that great landmark in medieval history, by reducing
the numbers of the craftsmen increased the
market value of the survivors, who at once demanded
and obtained higher wages. Parliament retorted
by passing the Statute of Labourers,<a name="Anchor-714" id="Anchor-714"></a><a href="#Footnote-714" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 714.">[714]</a> according to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>which no smith, carpenter, mason, tiler, shipwright,
leather-worker, tailor, or other artificer was to take
higher wages than he had received three years
earlier, before the pestilence. Though this was
legislation in favour of the employer, it was not
exactly a case of favouring the wealthy, for by
imposing a penalty on the giver of excessive wages
as well as upon the receiver, an attempt was made
to prevent the small employer being deprived of his
workmen by richer rivals. The Act was, so far as
we can judge, inspired partly by fear that the capitalist
might control the sources of labour, and partly
by fear that those sources might get beyond control.
Whatever its origin, the statute failed in its expressed
intention, and wages remained, as Thorold Rogers
has shown,<a name="Anchor-715" id="Anchor-715"></a><a href="#Footnote-715" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 715.">[715]</a> permanently higher. This was not due
to any laxity in applying the Act; for many years
after it was passed justices were appointed in every
part of England to enforce it,<a name="Anchor-716" id="Anchor-716"></a><a href="#Footnote-716" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 716.">[716]</a> but the records
of their proceedings, as for instance in Somerset in
1360,<a name="Anchor-717" id="Anchor-717"></a><a href="#Footnote-717" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 717.">[717]</a> where many hundreds of offenders are named,
show that the workmen had no hesitation in demanding,
and found no difficulty in getting wages higher
than the law allowed. Wholesale imprisonment
as a remedy for scarcity of labour was scarcely
satisfactory, and the small fines which were inflicted
proved no deterrent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>As the position of the artificer had improved
after the Black Death, so the crafts in general were
assuming a greater importance in public estimation,
and from about 1380 onwards the regulation of
industries occupies an increasing amount of space
on the Statute Rolls. With their growing influence,
most of the crafts began to make their voices heard
crying out for protection, which was usually given
them with a liberal hand. But, although the
pernicious effects of protective measures (deterioration
of quality and rise of price) were to a large
extent checked by the control kept over quality and
prices by the national and municipal authorities,
the consumer was sometimes roused to action.
One of the best instances of the struggle between
public and private interests is to be found in the
case of the Yarmouth herring fishery. Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr>
had granted to Yarmouth the monopoly of the sale
of herrings on the east coast during the season of the
fishery. As a consequence the price of herrings had
risen enormously, and the king was driven to cancel
the privilege: the men of Yarmouth at once began
to pull the strings, and in 1378 recovered their
monopoly, with the same result as before. Once
more the consumer made his voice heard, and in
1382 the Yarmouth charter was revoked, only to
be restored in 1385 on the ground that without
protection of this kind Yarmouth would be ruined.</p>

<p>If a large number of parliamentary enactments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>were protective of the producer, as for instance the
prohibition in 1463 of the import of a vast variety
of goods, from silk ribbands to dripping-pans, and
from razors to tennis balls, including such incompatibles
as playing cards and sacring bells,<a name="Anchor-718" id="Anchor-718"></a><a href="#Footnote-718" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 718.">[718]</a> yet still
more were protective of the consumer. For one
thing, of course, a single Act prohibiting certain
imports might protect a dozen classes of manufactures,
while the denunciation of one particular
species of fraud would probably lead ingenious
swindlers to invent a succession of others, each
requiring a separate Act for its suppression. Sentimental
admirers of the past are apt to imagine that
the medieval workman loved a piece of good work
for its own sake and never scamped a job. Nothing
could be further from the truth. The medieval
craftsman was not called a man of craft for nothing!
He had no more conscience than a plumber, and his
knowledge of ways that are dark and tricks that are
vain was extensive and peculiar. The subtle craft
of the London bakers, who, while making up their
customer's dough, stole a large portion of the dough
under their customers' eyes by means of a little
trap-door in the kneading-board and a boy sitting
under the counter,<a name="Anchor-719" id="Anchor-719"></a><a href="#Footnote-719" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 719.">[719]</a> was exceptional only in its
ingenuity. Cloth was stretched and strained to the
utmost and cunningly folded to hide defects, a
length of bad cloth would be joined on to a length of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>superior quality, or a whole cheap cloth substituted
for the good cloth which the customers had
purchased; inferior leather was faked up to look
like the best, and sold at night to the unwary;
pots and kettles were made of bad metal which
melted when put on the fire; and everything that
could be weighed or measured was sold by false
measure.</p>

<p>Prior to the middle of the sixteenth century
parliamentary attention was mainly concentrated
on the cloth trade, and the preambles to the various
statutes show that those in authority, including the
more responsible manufacturers, realised that
honesty is the best policy in the end. In 1390 it
was pointed out that the frauds of the west country
clothiers had not only endangered the reputations,
and even the lives, of merchants who brought them
for export, but had brought dishonour on the
English name abroad.<a name="Anchor-720" id="Anchor-720"></a><a href="#Footnote-720" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 720.">[720]</a> Two years later it was the
reputation of Guildford cloths that had been damaged
by sharp practices.<a name="Anchor-721" id="Anchor-721"></a><a href="#Footnote-721" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 721.">[721]</a> The worsteds of Norfolk had
early come into favour on the Continent, but in 1410
the Flemish merchants became exasperated at their
bad quality,<a name="Anchor-722" id="Anchor-722"></a><a href="#Footnote-722" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 722.">[722]</a> and thirty years later the foreign
demand for worsteds had been almost killed,<a name="Anchor-723" id="Anchor-723"></a><a href="#Footnote-723" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 723.">[723]</a> while
in 1464 English cloth in general was in grave disrepute,
not only abroad, but even in its native land,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>foreign cloth being largely imported.<a name="Anchor-724" id="Anchor-724"></a><a href="#Footnote-724" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 724.">[724]</a> To give them
their due, the gilds recognised the importance to
their own interests of maintaining a high standard
of workmanship, and co-operated loyally with the
municipal authorities to that end.</p>

<p>Although we have classed the control of industries
by municipal by-laws as 'external,' and control by
gild regulations as 'internal,' no hard and fast
line can really be drawn between the two. In
England, in contrast to the experience of many
Continental states, the two authorities worked together
with very little friction, the craft gilds recognising
the paramount position of the merchant gild
or town council, and the latter, in turn, protecting
the interest of the gilds and using their organisation
to control the various crafts. The question of the
origin of gilds is interesting rather than important,
and has given rise to much discussion. It is known
that the Roman crafts were organised into <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegia</i>,
but while it is quite possible that some of the trade
gilds in Constantinople, and even in Italy and Spain,
might be able to trace their pedigrees back to Roman
times, it is more than improbable that there was
any connection between the Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">collegia</i> and the
English craft gilds of the twelfth century. The gilds
of which we find mention in Anglo-Saxon records
were clearly fraternities of purely social and religious
import. These gilds, friendly societies for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>support of religious observances benefiting the souls
of all the members, and for the mutual relief of such
members as had met with misfortune, survived the
Conquest and increased greatly, till by the end of
the fourteenth century there could have been hardly
a village without at least one gild. It is natural to
suppose that in towns, where the choice of gilds was
considerable, there would be a tendency for members
of the same trade to join the same gild. The strength
gained by such union under the common bond of an
oath to obey the same statutes and the same officers,
and the advantage of the Church's protection must
soon have become obvious, and as in 1378 we find
the weavers of London forming a fraternity whose
ordinances are entirely of a religious nature and
contain no reference to the occupation of the
members,<a name="Anchor-725" id="Anchor-725"></a><a href="#Footnote-725" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 725.">[725]</a> so we may well believe that many of the
early gilds, while apparently purely religious, were
in fact trade unions. Whatever may have been the
methods in which craft gilds came into existence,
we find them increasing in numbers and influence
from the middle of the twelfth century onwards.
Meanwhile, however, the capitalists and wealthy
traders by means of 'merchant gilds' and similar
bodies had so firmly established an oligarchic control
over the towns and boroughs that they were
able to keep the craft gilds in a subordinate position.
Everywhere the town authorities, whether they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>mayor and council, or gild merchant, or governors,
could impose regulations upon the crafts, while such
rules as the crafts drew up for their own management
were legal only if accepted by the town council.
The case of Coventry was typical, where, in 1421, the
mayor and councillors summoned the wardens of
the crafts with their ordinances. 'And the poyntes
that byn lawfull good and honest for the Cite be
alowyd hem and all other thrown asid and had for
none.'<a name="Anchor-726" id="Anchor-726"></a><a href="#Footnote-726" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 726.">[726]</a> In the same way at Norwich in 1449, the
mayor drew up a complete set of ordinances for the
crafts.<a name="Anchor-727" id="Anchor-727"></a><a href="#Footnote-727" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 727.">[727]</a> But although keeping a firm hand on the
gilds, and taking measures to protect the interests
of the consumers and of the town in general, the
civic authorities left the gilds in control of the
internal affairs of their crafts. So that the craftsman
in his relations to another of the same trade
was a gild brother, but in his relations to all other
men he was a townsman.</p>

<p>From the consumer's point of view the regulation
of prices was perhaps the most important problem.
The price of raw material was too dependent upon
supply and demand to admit of much regulation,
though in 1355 Parliament interfered to bring down
the price of iron,<a name="Anchor-728" id="Anchor-728"></a><a href="#Footnote-728" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 728.">[728]</a> forbidding its export, and ordering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>the Justices of Labourers (<i>i.e.</i> those appointed to
enforce the Statute of Labourers) to punish all who
sold it too high. The local authorities, civic and
manorial, took constant measures to prevent the
artificial enhancement of what we may call raw
food stuffs, corn, fish, and meat, the 'regrator and
forestaller,' that is to say, the middleman, who
intercepted supplies before they reached the market
and forced prices up for his own sole benefit, being
universally regarded as a miscreant.<a name="Anchor-729" id="Anchor-729"></a><a href="#Footnote-729" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 729.">[729]</a> The economists
of that period had not grasped the fact that the
cleverness shown in buying an article cheap and
selling the same thing, without any further expenditure
of labour, dear, if done on a sufficiently large
scale, justifies the bestowal of the honour of knighthood
or a peerage. In the case of manufactured
food stuffs, such as bread and ale, the price was
automatically fixed by the price of the raw material,
and in general prices of manufactures were regulated
by the cost of the materials. Even in the case of
such artistic work as the making of waxen images,
it was considered scandalous that the makers should
charge as much as 2s. the pound for images when
wax was only 6d. the pound, and in 1432 the waxchandlers
were ordered not to charge for workmanship
more than 3d. the pound over the current price
of wax.<a name="Anchor-730" id="Anchor-730"></a><a href="#Footnote-730" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 730.">[730]</a> The principle that the craftsman should
be content with a reasonable profit, and not turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>the casual needs of his neighbours to his own benefit
is constantly brought out in local regulations, as, for
instance, in London in 1362, when in consequence of
the damage wrought by a great storm tiles were in
great demand, and the tilers were ordered to go on
making tiles and selling them at the usual prices.<a name="Anchor-731" id="Anchor-731"></a><a href="#Footnote-731" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 731.">[731]</a></p>

<p>The question of prices, which were thus so largely
composed of a varying sum for material, and a fixed
sum for workmanship, is very intimately connected
with the question of wages.<a name="Anchor-732" id="Anchor-732"></a><a href="#Footnote-732" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 732.">[732]</a> The medieval economist
seems to have accepted the Ruskinian theory that
all men engaged in a particular branch of trade
should be paid equal wages—with the corollary that
the better workman would obtain the more employment—as
opposed to the modern practice of payment
according to skill, which results in the greater employment
of the bad workman because he is cheap.<a name="Anchor-733" id="Anchor-733"></a><a href="#Footnote-733" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 733.">[733]</a>
There were, of course, grades in each profession, as
master or foreman, workman, and assistant or
common labourer, but within each grade the rate of
payment was fixed—at least within the jurisdiction
of any gild or town authority<a name="Anchor-734" id="Anchor-734"></a><a href="#Footnote-734" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 734.">[734]</a>—unless the work
was of quite exceptional nature, as, for instance, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>making of carved stalls for the royal chapel at Westminster
in 1357, where the rates of pay were almost
double those of ordinary workmen.<a name="Anchor-735" id="Anchor-735"></a><a href="#Footnote-735" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 735.">[735]</a> Wages were
at all times paid on the two systems of piece-work
and time, and the hours, which varied in the different
trades, and at different places and periods, were as
a rule long.<a name="Anchor-736" id="Anchor-736"></a><a href="#Footnote-736" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 736.">[736]</a> For the building trade at Beverley in
the fifteenth century work began in summer (from
Easter to 15th August) at 4 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, and continued till
7 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>; at 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> there was a quarter of an hour's
interval for refreshment, at 8 half an hour for breakfast,
at 11 an hour and a half to dine and sleep, and
at 3 half an hour for further refreshment. During
the winter months they worked from dawn till dusk,
with half an hour for breakfast at 9 o'clock, an hour
for dinner at noon, and a quarter of an hour's interval
at 3. These hours agree fairly well with those laid
down by Parliament in 1496,<a name="Anchor-737" id="Anchor-737"></a><a href="#Footnote-737" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 737.">[737]</a> which were, from
mid-March to mid-September, start at 5 and stop
work between 7 and 8, with half an hour for breakfast
and an hour and a half for dinner and sleep (the
siesta was only to be taken from beginning of May to
end of July, during the rest of the time there was to
be an hour for dinner and half an hour for lunch—'nonemete').
The blacksmiths of London worked,
at the end of the fourteenth century, from dawn till
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>9 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, except during November, December, and
January, when their hours were from 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to
8 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span><a name="Anchor-738" id="Anchor-738"></a><a href="#Footnote-738" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 738.">[738]</a> In the case of the Cappers' gild at Coventry
the journeymen's hours were in 1496 from 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to
6 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>;<a name="Anchor-739" id="Anchor-739"></a><a href="#Footnote-739" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 739.">[739]</a> but in 1520 they had been increased, being
from 6 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to 7 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> in winter, and from 5 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span> to
7 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span> in summer.<a name="Anchor-740" id="Anchor-740"></a><a href="#Footnote-740" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 740.">[740]</a> Wages, of course, when paid
by the day, varied in winter and summer, if we may
use these terms for the short and long days. In
London the determining dates were Easter and
Michaelmas,<a name="Anchor-741" id="Anchor-741"></a><a href="#Footnote-741" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 741.">[741]</a> at Bristol Ash Wednesday and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Calixtus (14th October),<a name="Anchor-742" id="Anchor-742"></a><a href="#Footnote-742" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 742.">[742]</a> and in the case of the
workmen at Westminster the Purification (2nd
February) and All Saints (1st November), giving an
exceptionally short winter period.<a name="Anchor-743" id="Anchor-743"></a><a href="#Footnote-743" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 743.">[743]</a></p>

<p>Against the long hours we have to set the comparative
frequency of holidays. On Sundays and
all the greater festivals, as well as a variable number
of local festivals, such as the dedication day of the
Church, no work was done, and on Saturdays and
the days preceding festivals work as a rule ceased
at four o'clock or earlier. This early closing was
enforced at Norwich<a name="Anchor-744" id="Anchor-744"></a><a href="#Footnote-744" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 744.">[744]</a> in 1490, on the representation
of the shoemakers that many of their journeymen
were 'greatly disposed to riot and idelnes, whereby
may succede grete poverte, so that dyuers days
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>wekely when them luste to leve ther bodyly labour
till a grete parte of the weke be almost so expended
and wasted ... also contrary to the lawe of god
and good guydyng temporall they labour quikly
toward the Sondaye and festyuall dayes on the
Saterdayes and vigils fro iiij of the clock at after
none to the depnes and derknes of the nyght foloweng.
And not onely that synfull disposicion but
moche warse so offendyng in the morownynges of
such festes and omyttyng the heryng of the dyvyne
servyce.' In the case of the founders in London,<a name="Anchor-745" id="Anchor-745"></a><a href="#Footnote-745" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 745.">[745]</a>
while no ordinary metal work, such as turning,
filing, or engraving, might be done after noon had
rung, an exception had to be made in the case of a
casting which was actually in progress; such work
might be completed after time, as otherwise the
metal would have to be remelted, even if it were not
spoilt by the interruption. So far as Sundays and
feasts were concerned no work was permitted except
in the case of farriers, who were expected to shoe the
horses of strangers passing through the town.<a name="Anchor-746" id="Anchor-746"></a><a href="#Footnote-746" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 746.">[746]</a> A
good many shops were open on the Sunday morning
until seven o'clock, especially shoemakers,<a name="Anchor-747" id="Anchor-747"></a><a href="#Footnote-747" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 747.">[747]</a> who in
Bristol were allowed at any time of the day to serve
'eny knyght or Squyer or eny other straunger
goyng on her passage or journee, merchant or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>maryner comyng fro the see,' or, during the six
Sundays of harvest, any one else who required boots.<a name="Anchor-748" id="Anchor-748"></a><a href="#Footnote-748" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 748.">[748]</a>
Markets during the early part of the thirteenth
century were often held on Sundays, but most of
these were soon shifted on to week days; and fairs
were usually associated with a saint's day, but a
fair was an amusement at which the ordinary craftsman
was an interested spectator, though the chapmen
and merchants were kept busy enough. The
London rule that Saturdays and vigils counted for
wages as complete days, but that no payment was
to be made for the Sundays and feast days<a name="Anchor-749" id="Anchor-749"></a><a href="#Footnote-749" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 749.">[749]</a> was
generally observed, but in the case of workmen
engaged in building operations at Westminster and
the Tower the custom was that wages should be
paid for alternate feast days, but not for any
Sundays.<a name="Anchor-750" id="Anchor-750"></a><a href="#Footnote-750" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 750.">[750]</a></p>

<p>Rules against working at night or after dark are
constantly found in all classes of industries, 'by
reason that no man can work so neatly by night as
by day.'<a name="Anchor-751" id="Anchor-751"></a><a href="#Footnote-751" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 751.">[751]</a> There was the additional reason that in
many trades night work was a source of annoyance
to neighbours. This was certainly the case with
the blacksmiths,<a name="Anchor-752" id="Anchor-752"></a><a href="#Footnote-752" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 752.">[752]</a> and was probably the cause of
the enactment by the Council in 1398, that no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>leather worker should work by night with hammer
and shears, knife or file, at making points or lanyers
(laces or thongs).<a name="Anchor-753" id="Anchor-753"></a><a href="#Footnote-753" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 753.">[753]</a> Worst of all these offenders were
the spurriers,<a name="Anchor-754" id="Anchor-754"></a><a href="#Footnote-754" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 754.">[754]</a> for 'many of the said trade are
wandering about all day without working at all at
their trade; and then when they have become
drunk and frantic, they take to their work, to the
annoyance of the sick and all their neighbourhood....
And then they blow up their fires so vigorously
that their forges begin all at once to blaze, to the
great peril of themselves and of all the neighbourhood
round.' Nuisances of this nature the authorities
put down by stringent by-laws, in the same way
that they banished offensive occupations, such as the
flaying of carcases, the dressing of skins, and the
burning of bricks, outside the walls.<a name="Anchor-755" id="Anchor-755"></a><a href="#Footnote-755" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 755.">[755]</a></p>

<p>A third reason for the prohibition of night work was
that candlelight not only made good work more
difficult, but made bad work more easy. Not only
was it easy to pass off faked leather and other
deceitful goods by the uncertain, artificial light,
which was one of the causes that moved the Council
to try to put down 'evechepyngs,'<a name="Anchor-756" id="Anchor-756"></a><a href="#Footnote-756" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 756.">[756]</a> or evening
markets, in London, but it also enabled fraudulent
workmen to avoid the eye of the vigilant searcher
or inspector.<a name="Anchor-757" id="Anchor-757"></a><a href="#Footnote-757" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 757.">[757]</a> All such evasion and secrecy was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>rightly regarded as suspicious, and at Bristol, to
take a single instance, weavers had to work at looms
visible from the public street, and not in cellars or
upstair rooms,<a name="Anchor-758" id="Anchor-758"></a><a href="#Footnote-758" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 758.">[758]</a> the better class of furs had also to be
worked in public,<a name="Anchor-759" id="Anchor-759"></a><a href="#Footnote-759" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 759.">[759]</a> and ale might not be sold in
private.<a name="Anchor-760" id="Anchor-760"></a><a href="#Footnote-760" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 760.">[760]</a> The medieval system of search or inspection
was very thorough, in theory and, so far as we
can judge, in practice also. The search of weights
and measures, provisions, cloth, and tanned leather
usually belonged to the mayor or equivalent borough
officer, or in country districts to the manorial lord,
but usually with other manufactures, and very often
in the case of cloth and leather, the mayor deputed
the duty of search to members of the craft gilds
elected and sworn for that purpose. They could
inspect the wares either in the workshops, or when
exposed for sale, and seize any badly made articles.
The forfeited goods were either burnt or given to the
poor,<a name="Anchor-761" id="Anchor-761"></a><a href="#Footnote-761" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 761.">[761]</a> and the offending craftsman fined, set in the
pillory, or, if an old offender, banished from the
town.<a name="Anchor-762" id="Anchor-762"></a><a href="#Footnote-762" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 762.">[762]</a> To facilitate tracing the responsibility for
bad work, weavers, fullers, hatters, metal workers,
tile-makers, and other craftsmen, including bakers,
were ordered to put their private trademarks on their
wares.<a name="Anchor-763" id="Anchor-763"></a><a href="#Footnote-763" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 763.">[763]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>The process of search must have been much
simplified by the custom so prevalent in medieval
towns of segregating or localising the trades,<a name="Anchor-764" id="Anchor-764"></a><a href="#Footnote-764" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 764.">[764]</a> so
that all the goldsmiths dwelt in one quarter, the
shoemakers in another, the clothiers in a third, and
so forth. How far this was compulsory, and how
far a mere matter of custom it is hard to say, but
for those who in addition to or instead of shops
sold by barrows or chapmen, definite districts were
usually assigned. So the London shoemakers might
only send out their goods to be hawked between
Sopers Lane and the Conduit, and then only in the
morning,<a name="Anchor-765" id="Anchor-765"></a><a href="#Footnote-765" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 765.">[765]</a> and at Bristol smiths were not to send
ironware through the town for sale in secret places,
but either to sell 'in here howse opynlych' or else
at their assigned place by the High Cross, where also
all strangers coming with 'eny penyworthes yclepid
smyth ware' were to stand.<a name="Anchor-766" id="Anchor-766"></a><a href="#Footnote-766" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 766.">[766]</a> The principle of segregation
was carried out still more strictly, as we
might expect, in the markets. A list of the stalls
in the provision market at Norwich in 1397<a name="Anchor-767" id="Anchor-767"></a><a href="#Footnote-767" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 767.">[767]</a> shows
forty butchers' stalls together, followed by forty-five
fishmongers and twenty-eight stalls in the
poulterers' market, of which nine were used for
fresh fish; then there were fifteen shops belonging
to the corporation in the wool-market, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>great building of the 'Worthsted Celd,' to which
all worsteds sent in from the country had to be
brought.<a name="Anchor-768" id="Anchor-768"></a><a href="#Footnote-768" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 768.">[768]</a> Other trades were localised in the same
way, and the two divisions of leather-workers, the
cordwainers and the workers of the inferior 'bazan'
or sheep's leather, were bidden each to keep to their
own set of stalls to prevent confusion and fraud.<a name="Anchor-769" id="Anchor-769"></a><a href="#Footnote-769" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 769.">[769]</a></p>

<p>As the trades were kept each to its own district,
so was the craftsman restricted to his own trade.
By a law issued in 1364 artificers were obliged to
keep to one 'mystery' or craft,<a name="Anchor-770" id="Anchor-770"></a><a href="#Footnote-770" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 770.">[770]</a> an exception being
made in favour of women acting as brewers, bakers,
carders, spinners, and workers of wool and linen
and silk,—the versatility of woman, the 'eternal
amateur,' being thus recognised some five centuries
and a half before Mr. Chesterton rediscovered it.
Later statutes forbade shoemakers, tanners, and
curriers to infringe on each other's province. It is
true that at Bristol<a name="Anchor-771" id="Anchor-771"></a><a href="#Footnote-771" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 771.">[771]</a> we find a puzzling regulation
that if a man who had not been apprenticed to
tanning practises the craft to which he was apprenticed
and also uses the craft of tanning, he shall
not pay anything to the tanner's craft but to his
own craft and his 'maistier servaunt de tanneres-crafte'
shall discharge the dues, etc. of a master of
the craft. But probably this belongs to the later
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>fifteenth century after the rise of capitalist employers;
if not, it is certainly exceptional, the general
tendency being to keep trades, and more especially
the allied trades, separate, in order presumably to
avoid the growth of 'combines' and monopolies.
For this reason fishmongers and fishermen were
forbidden to enter into partnership in London,<a name="Anchor-772" id="Anchor-772"></a><a href="#Footnote-772" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 772.">[772]</a>
because the dealers, knowing the needs of the city,
would be able to manipulate supplies and keep up
prices. The case against allowing all the branches
of one trade to come under single control is vividly
set out in the case of the Coventry iron workers in
1435:<a name="Anchor-773" id="Anchor-773"></a><a href="#Footnote-773" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 773.">[773]</a>—</p>

Neverthelater for his own eese he will com to his

And then the Brakemon most nedes do his maisters

then when the Brakemon hathe don his occupacion,
that that the mayster supposithe wilnot in no wyse

And so he dothe as his maister biddethe hyme. And

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>The interests of the craftsmen, or producers, were
as a whole opposed to those of the consumers. It
is true that they co-operated, as we have seen, with
the local authorities in maintaining the standard of
workmanship, because the craft that did not do
so would soon find itself 'defamed and out of employ,'<a name="Anchor-777" id="Anchor-777"></a><a href="#Footnote-777" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 777.">[777]</a>
but it was obviously to their interest to keep
up prices by the limitation of competition and of
output. Their success in restricting competition
varied very greatly in different trades and places.
In Lincoln, for instance, no tiler might come to work
in the town without joining the tilers' gild,<a name="Anchor-778" id="Anchor-778"></a><a href="#Footnote-778" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 778.">[778]</a> while
in Worcester, so far was this from being the case,
that the tilers were not even allowed to form a gild
at all.<a name="Anchor-779" id="Anchor-779"></a><a href="#Footnote-779" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 779.">[779]</a> As a whole the gilds had the townsmen
behind them in their opposition to outsiders. The
traditional attitude of the Englishman towards a
stranger has always been to 'heave half a brick at
him,' and as far back as 1421 the authorities at
Coventry had to order 'that no man throw ne cast
at noo straunge man, ne skorn hym.'<a name="Anchor-780" id="Anchor-780"></a><a href="#Footnote-780" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 780.">[780]</a> The sense
of civic, or even parochial, patriotism was more
developed in those times, and it was generally felt
that while artificers ought not to work for outsiders
unless there was no work to be had within the town,
on the other hand, employers ought to give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>preference to their fellow townsmen and not send
work out of the town.<a name="Anchor-781" id="Anchor-781"></a><a href="#Footnote-781" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 781.">[781]</a> As to encouraging strangers
to settle within their walls, sentiment varied in
different places. At Beverley in 1467 it was enacted
that any person might come and set up in his craft
without any payment for the first year—except a
contribution towards the church light and the yearly
pageant maintained by his craft—but after that he
should pay yearly 12d. to the town and 12d. to his
craft until he became a burgess and member of the
gild.<a name="Anchor-782" id="Anchor-782"></a><a href="#Footnote-782" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 782.">[782]</a> But the attitude of Bristol, where no one
might weave unless he became a burgess (and a
gild brother) was more typical of the general feeling.<a name="Anchor-783" id="Anchor-783"></a><a href="#Footnote-783" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 783.">[783]</a>
There was, however, at Bristol a rule that a stranger
who had come to the town on a visit, or to wait for
a ship might work at his trade for his support during
his stay.<a name="Anchor-784" id="Anchor-784"></a><a href="#Footnote-784" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 784.">[784]</a> This rule did not hold good, apparently,
at Hereford, as a London tailor, whose master had
allowed him during an outbreak of plague to go and
stay with relations in Hereford, was imprisoned by
the wardens of the local tailors' gild because he did
some tailoring for the cousin with whom he was
staying, in order to pay for his keep.<a name="Anchor-785" id="Anchor-785"></a><a href="#Footnote-785" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 785.">[785]</a> At Norwich,
by the ordinances of 1449, no 'foreign dweller'
might have any apprentices or even a hired servant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>unless the latter was absolutely necessary for his
business, and in that case at the end of a year he
must either 'buy himself a freeman,' or, if too poor
to buy the franchise, 'live under tribute to the
sheriffs.'<a name="Anchor-786" id="Anchor-786"></a><a href="#Footnote-786" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 786.">[786]</a></p>

<p>One advantage that the resident manufacturer
had over the foreigner was that his wares entered
the local market without the handicap of paying
customs or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">octroi</i> dues. Long lists of these dues on
every conceivable kind of merchandise, from bears
and monkeys to peppercorns, are to be found in the
records of many towns,<a name="Anchor-787" id="Anchor-787"></a><a href="#Footnote-787" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 787.">[787]</a> more especially seaports. It
is true that the burgesses of many towns, and the
tenants of many religious houses were theoretically
exempt from paying these dues, but it is probable
that the delay and worry of proving such exemption
was often felt to be a greater loss than payment.
So far as the alien importer was concerned, although
there was no such thing as a protective duty (the
import of an article was either prohibited altogether
or unrestrained), he might find himself called upon
to pay a higher, even a double, import duty on all
his merchandise. This policy of discriminating
against the alien, combined with the continual
harassing of the unfortunate foreign merchants,
induced many alien settlers to take out letters of
naturalisation, and the long lists of these in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>fifteenth century<a name="Anchor-788" id="Anchor-788"></a><a href="#Footnote-788" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 788.">[788]</a> show how numerous and widespread
these aliens were. Coming for the most
part from Flanders and the Low Countries, they
settled not only in London and the other great
towns, but in the smaller market towns and villages
throughout the country, exercising their various
trades as goldsmiths, clothmakers, leather-workers,
and so forth. In London in particular the foreign
element was very large from an early date and, as
a result of the invitation issued by Edward <abbr title="the third"><span class="smcap lowercase">III.</span></abbr> to
foreign clothworkers and their exemption from the
control of the native clothiers' gild, we have the
exceptional occurrence of a gild of alien weavers.
This gild, itself divided by the rivalries and quarrels
of the Flemings and Brabanters,<a name="Anchor-789" id="Anchor-789"></a><a href="#Footnote-789" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 789.">[789]</a> was unpopular
with the native weavers because, while competing
with them for trade, they did not share in the
farm or rent paid by the native gild to the king,
and in general there was a strong feeling against
the aliens in London, which was fanned by the craft
gilds and occasionally culminated in rioting, the
murder of some of the foreigners and the plunder
of their shops.</p>

<p>While the gilds were constantly coming into
conflict with outside interests, there was also an
internal conflict of interests between the masters,
the hired servants, or journeymen, and the intermediate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>class of apprentices. This becomes more
noticeable towards the end of our period. While
there was occasional friction between employer
and employed even before the second half of the
fourteenth century, it was during the next two
centuries that the rise of the capitalist, coupled with
the descent of the small independent masters into
the position of journeymen, brought about strained
relations between the two classes. In the earlier
period in most of the trades there was reasonable
prospect for any craftsman that he would be able
to set up as an independent master, but as time went
on the difficulty of attaining independence increased.
The growing attraction of town and craft life as
compared with agriculture swelled the ranks of the
craftsmen, and the gilds, whose management was in
the hands of the masters, endeavoured to limit
competition by raising their entrance fees and more
especially by raising their 'upsets,' that is to say
the fees which had to be paid by a craftsman upon
setting up as a master. One of the earliest instances
of this restriction of competition occurred in connection
with the weavers' gild of London, concerning
whom it was reported in 1321 that they had
during the last thirty years reduced the number of
looms in the city from 380 to 80.<a name="Anchor-790" id="Anchor-790"></a><a href="#Footnote-790" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 790.">[790]</a> In this case the
object was to benefit all the members of the gild
at the expense of the public, and not to protect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>existing masters from rivals within the gild, and the
method employed was therefore the raising of the
fee for entrance to the gild. This same weavers'
gild was so far ahead of its times that it had instituted
the modern trade unions' restriction of output, no
member being allowed to weave a cloth in less than
four days, though such a cloth could easily be woven
in three if not in two days.<a name="Anchor-791" id="Anchor-791"></a><a href="#Footnote-791" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 791.">[791]</a> But this was a most
exceptional move, if not absolutely unique.</p>

<p>How far the desire to restrict output was at the
bottom of regulations forbidding the employment
of more than a strictly limited number of apprentices
and journeymen, and how far such prohibitions
were inspired by fear of the monopolisation of
labour by capitalists it is difficult to say. Probably
the dread of the capitalist was the chief incentive
for such regulations, which are very numerous;
the cobblers of Bristol, for instance, being restricted
to a single 'covenaunt hynd,'<a name="Anchor-792" id="Anchor-792"></a><a href="#Footnote-792" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 792.">[792]</a> and the cappers of
Coventry allowed only two apprentices, neither of
whom might be replaced if he left with his master's
leave before the end of his term of seven years.<a name="Anchor-793" id="Anchor-793"></a><a href="#Footnote-793" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 793.">[793]</a>
The same principle of fair play between employers
led to the ordaining of heavy penalties for taking
away another man's servant, or employing any
journeyman who had not fulfilled his engagement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>with his previous master, and to the strict prohibition
of paying more than the fixed maximum wages.
As this last provision was sometimes got over by
the master's wife giving his servants extra gratuities
and gifts, this practice was forbidden at Bristol
in 1408, except that the master might at the end of
a year give 'a courtesy' of 20d. to his chief servant.<a name="Anchor-794" id="Anchor-794"></a><a href="#Footnote-794" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 794.">[794]</a>
As the unfair securing of labour by offering high
wages was forbidden, so the use of the cheap labour
of women was as a rule regarded with disfavour.
The fullers of Lincoln were forbidden to work with
any woman who was not the wife or maid of a master,<a name="Anchor-795" id="Anchor-795"></a><a href="#Footnote-795" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 795.">[795]</a>
and the 'braelers,' or makers of braces, of London,
in 1355, laid down 'that no one shall be so daring
as to set any woman to work in his trade, other than
his wedded wife or his daughter.'<a name="Anchor-796" id="Anchor-796"></a><a href="#Footnote-796" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 796.">[796]</a> A century later
the authorities at Bristol went even further, for
finding that the weavers were 'puttyn, occupien
and hiren ther wyfes, doughtours and maidens,
some to weve in ther owne lombes and some to hire
them to wirche with othour persons of the said crafte,'
whereby many 'likkely men to do the Kyng service
in his warris, ... and sufficiently lorned in the
seid crafte ... gothe vagraunt and unoccupied,'
absolutely forbade the practice in future, making
an exception only in the case of wives already so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>employed.<a name="Anchor-797" id="Anchor-797"></a><a href="#Footnote-797" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 797.">[797]</a> Of child labour we hear very little,
one of the few notices being an order on their behalf
made, suitably enough, by Richard Whittington
in 1398, that whereas some 'hurers' (makers of
fur caps) send their apprentices and journeymen
and children of tender age down to the Thames
and other exposed places, amid horrible tempests,
frosts, and snows, to scour caps, to the very great
scandal of the city, this practice is to cease at once.<a name="Anchor-798" id="Anchor-798"></a><a href="#Footnote-798" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 798.">[798]</a></p>

<p>Apprenticeship was from quite early times the
chief, and eventually became the only, path to
mastership. The ordinances of the London leather-dressers,<a name="Anchor-799" id="Anchor-799"></a><a href="#Footnote-799" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 799.">[799]</a>
made in 1347, and those of the pewterers,<a name="Anchor-800" id="Anchor-800"></a><a href="#Footnote-800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 800.">[800]</a>
made the next year, give as alternative qualifications
for reception into the craft the completion of a period
of apprenticeship, or the production of good testimony
that the applicant is a competent workman.
A similar certificate of ability was required of the
dyers at Bristol,<a name="Anchor-801" id="Anchor-801"></a><a href="#Footnote-801" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 801.">[801]</a> in 1407, even if they were apprentices,
but as a rule the completion of a term of
apprenticeship was a sufficient qualification. That
term might vary considerably, but the custom of
London, which held good in most English boroughs,
eventually fixed it at a minimum of seven years.
This would often be exceeded, and we find, for
instance, a boy of fourteen apprenticed to a haberdasher
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>in 1462 for the rather exceptional term of
twelve years; but in this case the master had
undertaken to provide him with two years' schooling,
the first year and a half to learn 'grammer,' and the
next half year to learn to write.<a name="Anchor-802" id="Anchor-802"></a><a href="#Footnote-802" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 802.">[802]</a> In a list of apprentices
who took the oath of fealty to the king and the
city at Coventry in 1494, the terms range from five
to nine years, though the majority were for seven
years; during the first years of their terms, they
were to receive nominal wages, usually 12d. a year,
and for their last year more substantial rewards,
varying from 6s. 8d. to 25s.<a name="Anchor-803" id="Anchor-803"></a><a href="#Footnote-803" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 803.">[803]</a> The oath to obey the
city laws serves as a reminder that the apprentice,
not being a full member of the gild, was under the
charge of the city authorities to some extent. Indentures
of apprenticeship had as a rule to be
enrolled by the town clerk,<a name="Anchor-804" id="Anchor-804"></a><a href="#Footnote-804" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 804.">[804]</a> and in London the
transfer of an apprentice from one employer to
another was not legal unless confirmed by the city
chamberlain.<a name="Anchor-805" id="Anchor-805"></a><a href="#Footnote-805" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 805.">[805]</a> Besides having his indentures enrolled,
and paying a fee to the craft gild, the apprentices,
or rather his friends, had to give a bond for
his good behaviour. The rights of the apprentice,
on the other hand, were probably always guarded
by a right of appeal to the wardens of his craft:
this was certainly the case at Coventry in 1520,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>the masters of the cappers being obliged to go once
a year to all the shops of their craft and call the
apprentices before them, and if any apprentice
complained three times against his master for
'insufficient finding,' they had power to take him
away and put him with another master.<a name="Anchor-806" id="Anchor-806"></a><a href="#Footnote-806" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 806.">[806]</a> As a
master's interest in his apprentice was transferable
to another master, so it was possible for an apprentice
to buy up the remainder of his term after he had
served a portion. He could not, however, be received
into his gild as a master until the whole of
his term had expired,<a name="Anchor-807" id="Anchor-807"></a><a href="#Footnote-807" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 807.">[807]</a> and although it would seem
that he could set up in business by himself,<a name="Anchor-808" id="Anchor-808"></a><a href="#Footnote-808" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 808.">[808]</a> probably
he might not employ workmen, and as a rule
he no doubt spent the unexpired portion of his term
as a journeyman.</p>

<p>The journeymen, working by the day (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">journée</i>),
either with their masters, or in their own houses, as
opposed to the covenant servants, who were hired by
the year,<a name="Anchor-809" id="Anchor-809"></a><a href="#Footnote-809" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 809.">[809]</a> and lived in their employer's house, constituted
the fluid element in the industrial organisation,
and were composed partly of men who had
served a full apprenticeship but lacked funds or
enterprise to set up independently, and partly of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>others who had either served only a brief apprenticeship,
or had picked up their knowledge of the craft
in other ways.<a name="Anchor-810" id="Anchor-810"></a><a href="#Footnote-810" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 810.">[810]</a> Although more or less free to work
for what employers they would, practically all gild
regulations contained a stringent order against the
employment of any journeyman who had broken
his contract or left his late master without good
reason.<a name="Anchor-811" id="Anchor-811"></a><a href="#Footnote-811" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 811.">[811]</a> In the matter of home work rules varied;
the journeymen of the wiredrawers and allied crafts
at Coventry in 1435 were allowed to work at home
and might not be compelled to come to their masters'
houses,<a name="Anchor-812" id="Anchor-812"></a><a href="#Footnote-812" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 812.">[812]</a> but in London, in 1271, the shoemakers
were not allowed to give out work, as the journeymen
were found to go off with the goods.<a name="Anchor-813" id="Anchor-813"></a><a href="#Footnote-813" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 813.">[813]</a> The
vagaries of this class, indeed, caused much heart-searching
to their masters. Instead of being content
with their holidays, and accepting their twelve
hours' working day, they had a pernicious habit
of going off on the spree for two or three days, and
amusing themselves by playing bowls, 'levyng ther
besynes at home that they shuld lyve by';<a name="Anchor-814" id="Anchor-814"></a><a href="#Footnote-814" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 814.">[814]</a> and the
Coventry employers, with that touching regard for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>widows and orphans (or in this case wives and
children) which has always distinguished the English
capitalists, forbade them to frequent inns on workdays,
'as it is daylye seen that they whiche be of the
pooreste sorte doo sytte all daye in the alehouse
drynkynge and playnge at the cardes and tables
and spende all that they can gett prodigally upon
themselfes to the highe displeasure of God and theyre
owne ympovershynge, whereas if it were spente at
home in theyre owne houses theyre wiffes and
childerne shulde have parte therof.'<a name="Anchor-815" id="Anchor-815"></a><a href="#Footnote-815" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 815.">[815]</a> Not having
any voice in the craft gilds the journeymen were
continually forming 'yeomen gilds,' 'bacheleries,'
and other combinations, which the masters' gilds
usually endeavoured to suppress. In 1387 the
London journeymen cordwainers formed a fraternity<a name="Anchor-816" id="Anchor-816"></a><a href="#Footnote-816" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 816.">[816]</a>
and endeavoured to secure it by obtaining papal
protection; nine years later the mayor and aldermen
put down a fraternity formed by the yeomen
of the saddlers, at the same time ordering the masters
to treat their men well in future,<a name="Anchor-817" id="Anchor-817"></a><a href="#Footnote-817" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 817.">[817]</a> and in 1415 the
wardens of the tailors complained that their journeymen
had combined, living together in companies
in particular houses, where they held assemblies,
and adopting a livery, whereupon the council, in
view of the danger to the peace of the city from
such an uncontrolled and irresponsible body, forbade
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>the combination and ordered the journeymen to
live under the governance of the wardens of the
craft.<a name="Anchor-818" id="Anchor-818"></a><a href="#Footnote-818" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 818.">[818]</a> The fraternity of the yeomen tailors, however,
was not so easily suppressed, and is found two
years later petitioning for leave to hold its yearly
assembly at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> John's, Clerkenwell.<a name="Anchor-819" id="Anchor-819"></a><a href="#Footnote-819" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 819.">[819]</a> In the same
way at Coventry, when the journeymen tailors'
gild of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Anne was suppressed in 1420, they simply
changed their patron and reappeared as the gild of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> George, against which measures were taken in
1425.<a name="Anchor-820" id="Anchor-820"></a><a href="#Footnote-820" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 820.">[820]</a> The charges against the yeomen saddlers
in 1396 were, that they had so forced wages up that
whereas the masters could formerly obtain a workman
for from 40s. to 5 marks yearly and his board
they had now to pay 10 or 12 marks or even £10, and
that also business was dislocated by the bedel coming
round and summoning the journeymen to attend
a service for the soul of a deceased brother. The
clashing of religious observances with business led
to an order at Coventry in 1528 that the journeymen
dyers should make no assemblies at weddings,
brotherhoods, or burials, nor make any 'caves'
(<i>i.e.</i> combinations), but use themselves as servants,
and as no craft.<a name="Anchor-821" id="Anchor-821"></a><a href="#Footnote-821" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 821.">[821]</a> This was practically an enforcement
of an order issued ten years earlier, that no
journeymen should form 'caves' without the licence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>of the mayor and the master of their craft.<a name="Anchor-822" id="Anchor-822"></a><a href="#Footnote-822" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 822.">[822]</a> Such
a licence would not as a rule be granted, unless the
masters were unusually broadminded, or the journeymen
exceptionally strong. There was, however, at
Coventry a recognised fraternity of journeymen
weavers in 1424; their wardens paid 12d. to the
chief master for every brother admitted; each
brother gave 4d. towards the cost of the craft
pageant, and the chief master contributed towards
the journeymen's altar lamp, while both masters and
servants held their feasts together.<a name="Anchor-823" id="Anchor-823"></a><a href="#Footnote-823" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 823.">[823]</a> At Bristol
also there was a gild of journeymen connected with
the shoemakers' craft, sharing with the craft gild
in the expenses of church lights and feasts.<a name="Anchor-824" id="Anchor-824"></a><a href="#Footnote-824" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 824.">[824]</a></p>

<p>The success of the London saddlers in forcing
wages up is a remarkable tribute to the power of
union; and we find that during the fourteenth century
the strike was well known, and when a master
would not agree with his workmen the other workmen
of the craft would come out and cease work
until the dispute was settled.<a name="Anchor-825" id="Anchor-825"></a><a href="#Footnote-825" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 825.">[825]</a> This practice was,
of course, forbidden, but we may doubt with what
success. At the same time the masters were pretty
well unanimous in forbidding the employment of a
craftsman whose dispute with his master had not
been settled. So far as the offence of detaining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>wages due was concerned, penalties were often laid
down in gild ordinances,<a name="Anchor-826" id="Anchor-826"></a><a href="#Footnote-826" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 826.">[826]</a> while in the case of other
disputes the matter would be settled by the council
or court of the craft.<a name="Anchor-827" id="Anchor-827"></a><a href="#Footnote-827" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 827.">[827]</a> The existence of a craft
gild practically implied a court before which disputes
between members of the craft or between craftsmen
and customers were tried.<a name="Anchor-828" id="Anchor-828"></a><a href="#Footnote-828" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 828.">[828]</a> Such courts were at first
directly under the borough authorities, the mayor
or his deputies presiding over the weekly courts of
the weavers in London in 1300,<a name="Anchor-829" id="Anchor-829"></a><a href="#Footnote-829" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 829.">[829]</a> and although they
seem to have attained a greater degree of independence
there seems usually to have been a right of
appeal to the borough court.<a name="Anchor-830" id="Anchor-830"></a><a href="#Footnote-830" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 830.">[830]</a> It was probably
to avoid this that some of the Coventry masters
took to impleading craftsmen in spiritual courts,
on the ground that they had broken their oaths in
not keeping the gild rules.<a name="Anchor-831" id="Anchor-831"></a><a href="#Footnote-831" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 831.">[831]</a></p>

<p>Too much attention must not be given to the
quarrelsome side of the gilds, for they were essentially
friendly societies for mutual assistance. One of the
rules of the London leather-dressers was that if a
member should have more work than he could
complete, and the work was in danger of being lost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>the other members should help him.<a name="Anchor-832" id="Anchor-832"></a><a href="#Footnote-832" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 832.">[832]</a> So also, if
a mason wished to undertake a contract he got four
or six responsible members of the craft to guarantee
his ability, and if he did not do the work well they
had to complete it.<a name="Anchor-833" id="Anchor-833"></a><a href="#Footnote-833" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 833.">[833]</a> Again, if a farrier undertook
the cure of a horse and was afraid that it would die,
he might call in the advice of the wardens of his
company, but if he was too proud to do so and the
horse died, he would be responsible to the owner.<a name="Anchor-834" id="Anchor-834"></a><a href="#Footnote-834" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 834.">[834]</a>
The rule of the weavers at Hull, that none should let
his apprentice work for another<a name="Anchor-835" id="Anchor-835"></a><a href="#Footnote-835" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 835.">[835]</a> was not an infringement
of the principle of mutual aid, but was designed
to prevent evasion of the order that none might
have more than two apprentices; the fact that a
fine was only exacted in the event of the apprentice
so working for more than thirteen days actually
points to the loan of temporary assistance being
allowed. While help was thus given to the craftsman
when in full employ, a still more essential
feature of the gilds was their grant of assistance to
members who had fallen ill or become impoverished
through no fault of their own.<a name="Anchor-836" id="Anchor-836"></a><a href="#Footnote-836" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 836.">[836]</a> Nor did their benevolence
end with the poor craftsman's death, for
they made an allowance to his widow and celebrated
Masses for the repose of his soul. The religious
element in the organisation of gilds, though very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>strong, does not affect us very much in considering
their industrial side, but there is one indirect effect
which must be referred to. The custom of all the
gilds and fraternities going in procession to the
chief church of their town on certain feast days,
carrying their banners and symbols, gradually developed
during the fifteenth century until each gild
endeavoured to outshine its rivals in pageantry.
Payments towards the pageants were exacted from
all members of the trade even if they were not
members of the gild, but in spite of this the expenses
were so great that the smaller gilds were almost
ruined, and consequently we find during the latter
half of the fifteenth century schemes to amalgamate,
or at any rate to unite for the support of a common
pageant, many of the smaller mysteries or crafts.
An account of a pageant at Norwich<a name="Anchor-837" id="Anchor-837"></a><a href="#Footnote-837" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 837.">[837]</a> about 1450 is
interesting as showing the numbers of these lesser
crafts, and the way in which they were combined.
Twelve pageants were presented: (1) The Creation
of the World, by the mercers, drapers, and haberdashers.
(2) Paradise, by the grocers and raffemen.
(3) 'Helle Carte,' by the glaziers, stainers, scriveners,
parchemyners, the carpenters, gravers, colermakers,
and wheelwrights. (4) Abel and Cain, by the
shearmen, fullers, 'thikwollenwevers,' and coverlet
makers, the masons and limeburners. (5) 'Noyse
shipp' (Noah's Ark), by the bakers, brewers, innkeepers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>cooks, millers, vintners, and coopers. (6)
Abraham and Isaac, by the tailors, broderers, the
reders and tylers. (7) Moses and Aaron with the
children of Israel and Pharaoh and his knights, by
the tanners, curriers, and cordwainers. (8) David
and Goliath, by the smiths. (9) The Birth of Christ,
by the dyers, calenders, the goldsmiths, goldbeaters,
saddlers, pewterers, and braziers. (10) The Baptism
of Christ, by the barbers, waxchandlers, surgeons,
physicians, the hardwaremen, the hatters, cappers,
skinners, glovers, pinners, pointmakers, girdlers,
pursers, bagmakers, 'sceppers,'<a name="Anchor-838" id="Anchor-838"></a><a href="#Footnote-838" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 838.">[838]</a> the wiredrawers
and cardmakers. (11) The Resurrection, by the
butchers, fishmongers, and watermen. (12) The
Holy Ghost, by the worsted weavers.</p>

<p>In some cases the smaller crafts seem to have
been absorbed into the larger, but in the Norwich
regulations of 1449,<a name="Anchor-839" id="Anchor-839"></a><a href="#Footnote-839" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 839.">[839]</a> when general orders were given
for the annexation of the smaller crafts to the
larger, the bladesmiths, locksmiths, and lorimers, for
instance, being united to the smiths, it was laid
down that such of the annexed misteries as had
seven or more members should elect their own
wardens, and that the mayor should appoint wardens
for such as had fewer than seven members. This,
which is interesting as showing how small some of
these misteries were, points to a retention of control,
the amalgamation being mainly concerned, no doubt,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>with the expenses of the pageant and the gild feasts.
These latter became so elaborate and costly that
many of the unfortunate members chosen as 'feast-makers'
were ruined, and in 1495 orders were given
at Norwich that the wardens alone should be feast-makers,
and that they should provide one supper
and one dinner, on the same day, and no more, and
that should be at the common expense of the gild.<a name="Anchor-840" id="Anchor-840"></a><a href="#Footnote-840" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 840.">[840]</a>
These orders had to be repeated in 1531, and it is
rather interesting to read that in 1547<a name="Anchor-841" id="Anchor-841"></a><a href="#Footnote-841" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 841.">[841]</a> the dishes
which had to be provided by the cordwainers' feast-makers
were 'frumenty, goos, vell, custard, pig,
lamb, and tarte. At soper—colde sute,<a name="Anchor-842" id="Anchor-842"></a><a href="#Footnote-842" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 842.">[842]</a> hot sute,
moten, douset,<a name="Anchor-843" id="Anchor-843"></a><a href="#Footnote-843" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 843.">[843]</a> and tarte.'</p>

<p>With the pleasant picture of our craftsman resting
from his labours and regaling himself in true
English fashion, we may take leave of him and his
work.</p>

William the Lion granted land at Alston as 'in Tyndale,'

latter grant being confirmed by King John in 1210. Finally,
after the whole matter had been carefully examined, Edward <abbr title="the first">I</abbr>.
